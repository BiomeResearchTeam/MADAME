Chase J, Fouquier J, Zare M, Sonderegger DL, Knight R, Kelley ST, Siegel J, Caporaso JG.	2.0	1	2487451	2016 Mar-Apr	0	2016	2016-03-01	mSystems	mSystems	mSystems	101680636	2379-5077	2379-5077	2016	e00022-16	In the United States, humans spend the majority of their time indoors, where they are exposed to the microbiome of the built environment (BE) they inhabit. Despite the ubiquity of microbes in BEs and their potential impacts on health and building materials, basic questions about the microbiology of these environments remain unanswered. We present a study on the impacts of geography, material type, human interaction, location in a room, seasonal variation, and indoor and microenvironmental parameters on bacterial communities in offices. Our data elucidate several important features of microbial communities in BEs. First, under normal office environmental conditions, bacterial communities do not differ on the basis of surface material (e.g., ceiling tile or carpet) but do differ on the basis of the location in a room (e.g., ceiling or floor), two features that are often conflated but that we are able to separate here. We suspect that previous work showing differences in bacterial composition with surface material was likely detecting differences based on different usage patterns. Next, we find that offices have city-specific bacterial communities, such that we can accurately predict which city an office microbiome sample is derived from, but office-specific bacterial communities are less apparent. This differs from previous work, which has suggested office-specific compositions of bacterial communities. We again suspect that the difference from prior work arises from different usage patterns. As has been previously shown, we observe that human skin contributes heavily to the composition of BE surfaces. IMPORTANCE Our study highlights several points that should impact the design of future studies of the microbiology of BEs. First, projects tracking changes in BE bacterial communities should focus sampling efforts on surveying different locations in offices and in different cities but not necessarily different materials or different offices in the same city. Next, disturbance due to repeated sampling, though detectable, is small compared to that due to other variables, opening up a range of longitudinal study designs in the BE. Next, studies requiring more samples than can be sequenced on a single sequencing run (which is increasingly common) must control for run effects by including some of the same samples in all of the sequencing runs as technical replicates. Finally, detailed tracking of indoor and material environment covariates is likely not essential for BE microbiome studies, as the normal range of indoor environmental conditions is likely not large enough to impact bacterial communities.

Metabolomic profiles were determined by gas and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry in a cross-sectional study. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene populations revealed samples clustered into three community state types (CSTs) ---- CST-I (L. crispatus-dominated), CST-III (L. iners-dominated) or CST-IV (low-Lactobacillus). We identified 607 metabolites, including 12 that differed significantly (q-value < 0.05) between smokers and non-smokers. Nicotine, and the breakdown metabolites cotinine and hydroxycotinine were substantially higher in smokers, as expected. Among women categorized to CST-IV, biogenic amines, including agmatine, cadaverine, putrescine, tryptamine and tyramine were substantially higher in smokers, while dipeptides were lower in smokers. These biogenic amines are known to affect the virulence of infective pathogens and contribute to vaginal malodor. Our data suggest that cigarette smoking is associated with differences in important vaginal metabolites, and women who smoke, and particularly women who are also depauperate for Lactobacillus spp., may have increased susceptibilities to urogenital infections and increased malodor.

Inflammatory markers were not highly expressed with increasing VLY.

HPV<sup>+</sup> women had higher biogenic amine and phospholipid concentrations compared with HPV<sup>-</sup> women after adjustment for CST and cigarette smoking. Metabolomic profiles of HPV<sup>+</sup> and HPV<sup>-</sup> women differed in strata of CST. In CST III, there were higher concentrations of biogenic amines and glycogen-related metabolites in HPV<sup>+</sup> women than in HPV<sup>-</sup> women. In CST IV, there were lower concentrations of glutathione, glycogen, and phospholipid-related metabolites in HPV<sup>+</sup> participants than in HPV<sup>-</sup> participants. Across all CSTs, women with hrHPV strains had lower concentrations of amino acids, lipids, and peptides compared with women who had only low-risk HPV (lrHPV).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The vaginal metabolome of HPV<sup>+</sup> women differed from HPV<sup>-</sup> women in terms of several metabolites, including biogenic amines, glutathione, and lipid-related metabolites. If the temporal relation between increased levels of reduced glutathione and oxidised glutathione and HPV incidence/persistence is confirmed in future studies, anti-oxidant therapies may be considered as a non-surgical HPV control intervention.<h4>Tweetable abstract</h4>Metabolomics study: Vaginal microenvironment of HPV<sup>+</sup> women may be informative for non-surgical interventions.

Here, we employed a combination of behavioral, molecular and computational techniques to test the role of the microbiota in mediating despair behavior. In chronically stressed mice displaying despair behavior, we found that the microbiota composition and the metabolic signature dramatically change. Specifically, we observed reduced Lactobacillus and increased circulating kynurenine levels as the most prominent changes in stressed mice. Restoring intestinal Lactobacillus levels was sufficient to improve the metabolic alterations and behavioral abnormalities. Mechanistically, we identified that Lactobacillus-derived reactive oxygen species may suppress host kynurenine metabolism, by inhibiting the expression of the metabolizing enzyme, IDO1, in the intestine. Moreover, maintaining elevated kynurenine levels during Lactobacillus supplementation diminished the treatment benefits. Collectively, our data provide a mechanistic scenario for how a microbiota player (Lactobacillus) may contribute to regulating metabolism and resilience during stress.

Our study examines the changes to the gut microbiome that occur during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for MS. We collected fecal samples at key stages of EAE progression and quantified microbial abundances with 16S V3-V4 amplicon sequencing. Our analysis of the data suggests that the abundance of commensal Lactobacillaceae decreases during EAE while other commensal populations belonging to the Clostridiaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Peptostreptococcaceae families expand. Community analysis with microbial co-occurrence networks points to these three expanding taxa as potential mediators of gut microbiome dysbiosis. We also employed PICRUSt2 to impute MetaCyc Enzyme Consortium (EC) pathway abundances from the original microbial abundance data. From this analysis, we found that a number of imputed EC pathways responsible for the production of immunomodulatory compounds appear to be enriched in mice undergoing EAE. Our analysis and interpretation of results provides a detailed picture of the changes to the gut microbiome that are occurring throughout the course of EAE disease progression and helps to evaluate EAE as a viable model for gut dysbiosis in MS patients.
