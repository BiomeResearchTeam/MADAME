We sought to determine how bacterial contamination and persistent MDRO colonization of the healthcare environment are related to the position of patients and wastewater sites.<h4>Methods</h4>We performed a prospective cohort study, enrolling 51 hospital rooms at the time of admitting a patient with an eligible MDRO in the prior 30 days. We performed systematic sampling and MDRO culture of rooms, as well as 16S rRNA sequencing to define the environmental microbiome in a subset of samples.<h4>Results</h4>The probability of detecting resistant gram-negative organisms, including Enterobacterales, <i>Acinetobacter</i> spp, and <i>Pseudomonas</i> spp, increased with distance from the patient. In contrast, <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> and methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> were more likely to be detected close to the patient. Resistant <i>Pseudomonas</i> spp and <i>S. aureus</i> were enriched in these hot spots despite broad deposition of 16S rRNA gene sequences assigned to the same genera, suggesting modifiable factors that permit the persistence of these MDROs.<h4>Conclusions</h4>MDRO hot spots can be defined by distance from the patient and from wastewater reservoirs. Evaluating how MDROs are enriched relative to bacterial DNA deposition helps to identify healthcare micro-environments and suggests how targeted environmental cleaning or design approaches could prevent MDRO persistence and reduce infection risk.
