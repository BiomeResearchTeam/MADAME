A striking alteration and diversification in the skin microbiome with aging was observed between two different age groups of 37 healthy Japanese women, i.e. younger adults of 21-37 years old and older adults of 60-76 years old, using bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The analyses revealed that the alpha diversity/species richness was significantly higher in the older than the younger group for the cheek and forehead microbiomes, while the beta diversity in the overall structure significantly differed particularly for the forearm and scalp microbiomes between the two age groups. Taxonomic profiling showed a striking reduction in the relative abundance of the majority skin genus Propionibacterium in the cheek, forearm and forehead microbiomes of the older adults, and identified 38 species including many oral bacteria that significantly differentiated the two age groups with a skin site dependency. Furthermore, we found chronological age-related and unrelated skin clinical parameters that correlate with the observed changes in the skin microbiome diversity. Thus, our data suggested that the diversification of skin microbiomes in adult women was largely affected by chronological and physiological skin aging in association with oral bacteria.

However, the microbial role has not been elucidated yet, and the etiology of the disorder remains poorly understood. Using high-throughput 16S rDNA and ITS1 sequencing, we characterized cutaneous bacterial and fungal microbiotas from healthy and dandruff subjects, comparing scalp and forehead (lesional and non-lesional skin sites). Bacterial and fungal communities from dandruff analyzed at genus level differed in comparison with healthy ones, presenting higher diversity and greater intragroup variation. The microbial shift was observed also in non-lesional sites from dandruff subjects, suggesting that dandruff is related to a systemic process that is not restricted to the site exhibiting clinical symptoms. In contrast, <i>Malassezia</i> microbiota analyzed at species level did not differ according to health status. A 2-step OTU assignment using combined databases substantially increased fungal assigned sequences, and revealed the presence of highly prevalent uncharacterized <i>Malassezia</i> organisms (>37% of the reads). Although clinical symptoms of dandruff manifest locally, microbial dysbiosis beyond clinically affected skin sites suggests that subjects undergo systemic alterations, which could be considered for redefining therapeutic approaches.

Despite this, the gastrointestinal tract is quickly colonized by fecal microbes. The hands are an important vector for the transmission of microbes, but the frequency at which fecal and oral microbes exist on hands and the source of those microbes have not been extensively described. Using data from a previous study that characterized the fecal, oral, and skin microbiota from 73 families, we found a significant incidence of fecal and oral microbes on hands. Of palms, 48.9% had fecal signal and 67.2% had oral signal. Fecal, oral, and forehead microbes were tracked to family members and an individual's own palms far more often than to unrelated individuals and showed relationships with age, gender, and parental status. For instance, oral microbes that were specifically sourced to the same individual (oneself) were most common on infant palms; mothers had more infant-child-sourced and oral-sourced microbes on their palms than nonparents. Fecal microbes on palms more often sourced to members of the family than unrelated individuals, but more often to other members of the family than oneself. This study supports that the hands are an important vector for the transfer of fecal and oral microbes within families. IMPORTANCE Bacteria live all around us, and we are constantly exposed to them during our everyday lives. Modern standards of hygiene aim to limit exposure to fecal bacteria, and yet bacteria rapidly colonize the gut in early life and following antibacterial treatment. Exposures to fecal and oral microbes provide risk of disease, but are also necessary since commensal microbes play important roles in health. This work establishes that bacteria of both fecal and oral origins are commonly found on hands. It also establishes that the uniqueness of fecal and oral bacterial communities across people can allow for determination of the likely individual from whom the fecal and oral bacteria came. These techniques allow for understanding the hands as a vector for microbial transmission within families and across populations, which has important implications for public health.

We previously demonstrated that Atg7 knockout impaired angiogenesis in the mouse brain. However, the role of Atg7 in angiogenesis is not completely understood. In this study, we used human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) to investigate the mechanism of Atg7-regulated cerebral angiogenesis. We found that Atg7 depletion specifically diminished the expression of the β3 and γ2 chains of laminin-5, a major component of the extracellular matrix. In contrast, autophagy inhibitors did not affect laminin-5 expression, suggesting that Atg7-regulated laminin-5 expression is autophagy-independent. We also found that Atg7-regulated laminin-5 expression occurred at the transcriptional level through NF-κB signaling. Exogenous laminin-5 or the NF-κB agonist betulinic acid effectively rescued tube formation by Atg7-deficient HBMECs. Taken together, our study identified a novel mechanism by which Atg7 regulates laminin-5 expression via NF-κB to modulate tube formation by brain endothelial cells during cerebral angiogenesis.

Polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) transendothelial migration across the blood-brain barrier, one of the three hallmarks of bacterial meningitis, now is considered as a ""double-edge sword"". When participating in host immune system defending against virulent pathogens, it results in tissue inflammation and following severe damage of central nervous system at the same time, which contributes to a disastrous consequence. Recently, several researches have focused on this multi-step process and the mechanism of how the virulent factors of different pathogens influence PMN migration. The great progression they made has enlightened a new research hotspot and a novel therapeutic strategy.

To investigate CASPR1's physiological role in BMECs, here we used CASPR1 as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify CASPR1-interacting proteins and identified the β3 subunit of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (ATP1B3) as a CASPR1-binding protein. Using recombinant and purified CASPR1, RNAi, GST-pulldown, immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity assays, we found that ATP1B3's core proteins, but not its glycosylated forms, interact with CASPR1, which was primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum of BMECs. CASPR1 knockdown reduced ATP1B3 glycosylation and prevented its plasma membrane localization, phenotypes that were reversed by expression of full-length CASPR1. We also found that the CASPR1 knockdown reduces the plasma membrane distribution of the α1 subunit of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, which is the major component assembled with ATP1B3 in the complete Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase complex. The binding of CASPR1 with ATP1B3, but not the α1 subunit, indicated that CASPR1 binds with ATP1B3 to facilitate the assembly of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. Furthermore, the activity of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase was reduced in CASPR1-silenced BMECs. Interestingly, shRNA-mediated CASPR1 silencing reduced glutamate efflux through the BMECs. These results demonstrate that CASPR1 binds with ATP1B3 and thereby contributes to the regulation of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase maturation and trafficking to the plasma membrane in BMECs. We conclude that CASPR1-mediated regulation of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity is important for glutamate transport across the blood-brain barrier.

However, the physiological role of Caspr1 in BMECs remains unclear. We previously reported the nonamyloidogenic processing of amyloid protein precursor (APP) pathway in the human BMECs (HBMECs). In this study, we found Caspr1 depletion reduced the levels of soluble amyloid protein precursor α (sAPPα) in the supernatant of HBMECs, which could be rescued by expression of full-length Caspr1. Our further results showed that ADAM9, the α-secretase essential for processing of APP to generate sAPPα, was decreased in Caspr1-depleted HBMECs. The reduced sAPPα secretion in Caspr1-depleted HBMECs was recovered by expression of exogenous ADAM9. Then, we identified that Caspr1 specifically regulates the expression of ADAM9, but not ADAM10 and ADAM17, at transcriptional level by nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway. Caspr1 knockout attenuated the activation of NF-κB and prevented the nuclear translocation of p65 in brain endothelial cells, which was reversed by expression of full-length Caspr1. The reduced sAPPα production and ADAM9 expression upon Caspr1 depletion were effectively recovered by NF-κB agonist. The results of luciferase assays indicated that the NF-κB binding sites are located at -859 bp to -571 bp of ADAM9 promoter. Taken together, our results demonstrated that Caspr1 facilitates sAPPα production by transcriptional regulation of α-secretase ADAM9 in brain endothelial cells.

In a recent paper (Nat Commun 9:2296), we identify Caspr1 as a host receptor for <i>E. coli</i> virulence factor IbeA to pave the way the penetration of bacteria through the BBB. Bacterial IbeA interacts with endothelial Caspr1 to trigger intracellular focal adhesion kinase activation, leading to <i>E. coli</i> internalization into the brain endothelial cells. Importantly, endothelial knockout of Caspr1 in mice significantly reduced <i>E. coli</i> crossing through the BBB. Based on the results that extracellular aa 203-355 of Caspr1 bind with IbeA, we tested the blocking effect of recombinant Caspr1(203-355) peptides in neonatal rat model of meningitis. The results showed that Caspr1(203-355) peptides effectively attenuated <i>E. coli</i> penetration into the brain during meningitis, indicating that Caspr1(203-355) peptides could be used to neutralize the virulent IbeA to prevent meningitis. We further found that <i>E. coli</i> can directly invade into hippocampal neurons causing apoptosis which required the interaction between bacterial IbeA and neuronal Caspr1. These findings demonstrate that <i>E. coli</i> hijack Caspr1 as a host receptor for penetration of BBB and invasion of hippocampal neurons, resulting in progression of meningitis.

Although the local inflammatory responses are known to play a primary role in the brain I/R injury, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In the current study, we investigated the effect of brain endothelial Atg7 (autophagy related 7) depletion in the acute brain injury induced by ischemia and reperfusion. Endothelial knockout of Atg7 in mice (Atg7 eKO) was found to significantly attenuate both the infarct volume and the neurological defects induced by I/R when compared to the controls. In fact, brain inflammatory responses induced by I/R were alleviated by the Atg7 eKO. Furthermore, an increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α, was observed in brain endothelial cells in response to oxygen/glucose depletion/reoxygenation, which was decreased by the shRNA-mediated Atg7 knockdown. Interestingly, Atg7 knockdown reduced IKKβ phosphorylation, leading to NF-κB deactivation and downregulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines mRNA levels. Further, Atg7 transcriptional regulation function is independent of its role in autophagy. Taken together, our results demonstrated that brain endothelial Atg7 contributes to brain damage during I/R by modulating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Depletion of Atg7 in brain endothelium has a neuroprotective effect against the ischemia/reperfusion-induced acute cerebral injury during stroke.

High elevation is positively correlated with various extreme environmental conditions (i.e., high ultraviolet radiation), which may exert selection pressure on skin microbiota, and therefore influence human health. Most studies regarding skin microbial communities have focused on low-elevation hosts. Few studies have explored skin microbiota in high-elevation humans. Here, we investigated the diversity, function, assembly, and co-occurrence patterns of skin microbiotas from 35 health human subjects across three body sites (forehead, opisthenar, and palm) and seven elevation gradients from 501 to 3431 m. Alpha diversity values (i.e., Shannon diversity and observed operational taxonomic units (OTUs)) decreased with increasing elevation regardless of the body site, while beta diversity (Jaccard and Bray-Curtis dissimilarities) showed an increasing trend with elevation. Elevation is a significant factor that influences human skin microbiota, even after controlling host-related factors. Skin microbiotas at high elevation with more than 3000 m on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, had a significant structural or functional separation from those at low elevation with less than 3000 m. Notably, the clustering coefficient, average degree, and network density were all lower at high-elevation than those at low-elevation, suggesting that high-elevation skin networks were more fragile and less connected. Phylogenetic analysis showed that human skin microbiotas are mainly dominated by stochastic processes (58.4%-74.6%), but skin microbiotas at high-elevation harbor a greater portion of deterministic processes than those at low-elevation, indicating that high-elevation may be conducive to the promotion of deterministic processes. Our results reveal that the filtering and selection of the changeable high-elevation environment on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau may lead to less stable skin microbial community structures.

E. coli penetration of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the critical step for development of meningitis. Here, we identify Caspr1, a single-pass transmembrane protein, as a host receptor for E. coli virulence factor IbeA to facilitate BBB penetration. Genetic ablation of endothelial Caspr1 and blocking IbeA-Caspr1 interaction effectively prevent E. coli penetration into the brain during meningitis in rodents. IbeA interacts with extracellular domain of Caspr1 to activate focal adhesion kinase signaling causing E. coli internalization into the brain endothelial cells of BBB. E. coli can invade hippocampal neurons causing apoptosis dependent on IbeA-Caspr1 interaction. Our results indicate that E. coli exploits Caspr1 as a host receptor for penetration of BBB resulting in meningitis, and that Caspr1 might be a useful target for prevention or therapy of E. coli meningitis.

We used genomic, phenotypic and virulence studies to identify differences between Acinetobacter species. Fourteen strains representing nine species were examined. Genomic analysis of six strains showed that the A. baumannii core genome contains many genes important for diverse metabolism and survival in the host. Most of the A. baumannii core genes were also present in one or more of the less clinically successful species. In contrast, when the accessory genome of an individual A. baumannii strain was compared to a strain of a less successful species (A. calcoaceticus RUH2202), many operons with putative virulence function were found to be present only in the A. baumannii strain, including the csu operon, the acinetobactin chromosomal cluster, and bacterial defence mechanisms. Phenotype microarray analysis showed that compared to A. calcoaceticus (RUH2202), A. baumannii ATCC 19606(T) was able to utilise nitrogen sources more effectively and was more tolerant to pH, osmotic and antimicrobial stress. Virulence differences were also observed, with A. baumannii ATCC 19606(T), A. pittii SH024, and A. nosocomialis RUH2624 persisting and forming larger biofilms on human skin than A. calcoaceticus. A. baumannii ATCC 19606(T) and A. pittii SH024 were also able to survive in a murine thigh infection model, whereas the other two species were eradicated. The current study provides important insights into the elucidation of differences in clinical relevance among Acinetobacter species.
