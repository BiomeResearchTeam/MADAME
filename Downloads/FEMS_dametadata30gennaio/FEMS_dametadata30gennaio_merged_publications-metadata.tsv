We hypothesized that bacteria or their products exist below the surface epithelium and thus permit physical interaction between microbes and dermal cells. Here to test this hypothesis, we employed multiple independent detection techniques for bacteria including quantitative PCR, Gram staining, immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization. Bacteria were consistently detectable within the dermis and dermal adipose of normal human skin. Sequencing of DNA from dermis and dermal adipose tissue identified bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA reflective of a diverse and partially distinct microbial community in each skin compartment. These results show the microbiota extends within the dermis, therefore, enabling physical contact between bacteria and various cells below the basement membrane. These observations show that normal commensal bacterial communities directly communicate with the host in a tissue previously thought to be sterile.

Viral communities have the potential to modulate states of cutaneous health and disease. Bacteriophages are known to influence the structure and function of microbial communities through predation and genetic exchange. Human viruses are associated with skin cancers and a multitude of cutaneous manifestations. Despite these important roles, little is known regarding the human skin virome and its interactions with the host microbiome. Here we evaluated the human cutaneous double-stranded DNA virome by metagenomic sequencing of DNA from purified virus-like particles (VLPs). In parallel, we employed metagenomic sequencing of the total skin microbiome to assess covariation and infer interactions with the virome. Samples were collected from 16 subjects at eight body sites over 1 month. In addition to the microenviroment, which is known to partition the bacterial and fungal microbiota, natural skin occlusion was strongly associated with skin virome community composition. Viral contigs were enriched for genes indicative of a temperate phage replication style and also maintained genes encoding potential antibiotic resistance and virulence factors. CRISPR spacers identified in the bacterial DNA sequences provided a record of phage predation and suggest a mechanism to explain spatial partitioning of skin phage communities. Finally, we modeled the structure of bacterial and phage communities together to reveal a complex microbial environment with a Corynebacterium hub. These results reveal the previously underappreciated diversity, encoded functions, and viral-microbial dynamic unique to the human skin virome. IMPORTANCE:To date, most cutaneous microbiome studies have focused on bacterial and fungal communities. Skin viral communities and their relationships with their hosts remain poorly understood despite their potential to modulate states of cutaneous health and disease. Previous studies employing whole-metagenome sequencing without purification for virus-like particles (VLPs) have provided some insight into the viral component of the skin microbiome but have not completely characterized these communities or analyzed interactions with the host microbiome. Here we present an optimized virus purification technique and corresponding analysis tools for gaining novel insights into the skin virome, including viral ""dark matter,"" and its potential interactions with the host microbiome. The work presented here establishes a baseline of the healthy human skin virome and is a necessary foundation for future studies examining viral perturbations in skin health and disease."

Compared to culture-based techniques, DNA sequencing of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene or whole metagenome shotgun (WMS) sequencing provides more precise microbial community characterizations. Most widely used protocols were developed to characterize microbiota of other habitats (i.e., gastrointestinal) and have not been systematically compared for their utility in skin microbiome surveys. Here we establish a resource for the cutaneous research community to guide experimental design in characterizing skin microbiota. We compare two widely sequenced regions of the 16S rRNA gene to WMS sequencing for recapitulating skin microbiome community composition, diversity, and genetic functional enrichment. We show that WMS sequencing most accurately recapitulates microbial communities, but sequencing of hypervariable regions 1-3 of the 16S rRNA gene provides highly similar results. Sequencing of hypervariable region 4 poorly captures skin commensal microbiota, especially Propionibacterium. WMS sequencing, which is resource and cost intensive, provides evidence of a community's functional potential; however, metagenome predictions based on 16S rRNA sequence tags closely approximate WMS genetic functional profiles. This study highlights the importance of experimental design for downstream results in skin microbiome surveys.

An understanding of evolutionary and adaptive patterns associated with genomic variability will help guide development of vaccines and antimicrobial agents. While most analyses of the human microbiome have focused on taxonomic classification and gene annotation, we investigated genomic variation of skin-associated viral communities. We evaluated patterns of viral genomic variation across 16 healthy human volunteers. Human papillomavirus (HPV) and <i>Staphylococcus</i> phages contained 106 and 465 regions of diversification, or hypervariable loci, respectively. <i>Propionibacterium</i> phage genomes were minimally divergent and contained no hypervariable loci. Genes containing hypervariable loci were involved in functions including host tropism and immune evasion. HPV and <i>Staphylococcus</i> phage hypervariable loci were associated with purifying selection. Amino acid substitution patterns were virus dependent, as were predictions of their phenotypic effects. We identified diversity generating retroelements as one likely mechanism driving hypervariability. We validated these findings in an independently collected skin metagenomic sequence dataset, suggesting that these features of skin virome genomic variability are widespread. Our results highlight the genomic variation landscape of the skin virome and provide a foundation for better understanding community viral evolution and the functional implications of genomic diversification of skin viruses.

Most previous work has relied on studying bacteria and viruses independently, thereby reducing them to two separate communities. Such approaches are unable to capture how these microbial communities interact, such as through processes that maintain community robustness or allow phage-host populations to co-evolve. We implemented a network-based analytical approach to describe phage-bacteria network diversity throughout the human body. We built these community networks using a machine learning algorithm to predict which phages could infect which bacteria in a given microbiome. Our algorithm was applied to paired viral and bacterial metagenomic sequence sets from three previously published human cohorts. We organized the predicted interactions into networks that allowed us to evaluate phage-bacteria connectedness across the human body. We observed evidence that gut and skin network structures were person-specific and not conserved among cohabitating family members. High-fat diets appeared to be associated with less connected networks. Network structure differed between skin sites, with those exposed to the external environment being less connected and likely more susceptible to network degradation by microbial extinction events. This study quantified and contrasted the diversity of virome-microbiome networks across the human body and illustrated how environmental factors may influence phage-bacteria interactive dynamics. This work provides a baseline for future studies to better understand system perturbations, such as disease states, through ecological networks.

While recent studies have begun to shed light on the valuable role that skin microorganisms have in maintaining the skin barrier, a detailed understanding of the complex interactions that shape healthy skin microbial communities is limited. Cobamides, the vitamin B<sub>12</sub> class of cofactor, are essential for organisms across the tree of life. Because this vitamin is only produced by a limited fraction of prokaryotes, cobamide sharing is predicted to mediate community dynamics within microbial communities. Here, we provide the first large-scale metagenomic assessment of cobamide biosynthesis and utilization in the skin microbiome. We show that while numerous and diverse taxa across the major bacterial phyla on the skin encode cobamide-dependent enzymes, relatively few species encode <i>de novo</i> cobamide biosynthesis. We show that cobamide producers and users are integrated into the network structure of microbial communities across the different microenvironments of the skin and that changes in microbiome community structure and diversity are associated with the abundance of cobamide producers in the <i>Corynebacterium</i> genus, for both healthy and diseased skin states. Finally, we find that <i>de novo</i> cobamide biosynthesis is enriched only in <i>Corynebacterium</i> species associated with hosts, including those prevalent on human skin. We confirm that the cofactor is produced in excess through quantification of cobamide production by human skin-associated species isolated in the laboratory. Taken together, our results reveal the potential for cobamide sharing within skin microbial communities, which we hypothesize mediates microbiome community dynamics and host interactions. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> The skin microbiome is essential for maintaining skin health and function. However, the microbial interactions that dictate microbiome structure, stability, and function are not well understood. Here, we investigate the biosynthesis and use of cobamides, a cofactor needed by many organisms but only produced by select prokaryotes, within the human skin microbiome. We found that while a large proportion of skin taxa encode cobamide-dependent enzymes, only a select few encode <i>de novo</i> cobamide biosynthesis. Further, the abundance of cobamide-producing <i>Corynebacterium</i> species is associated with skin microbiome diversity and structure, and within this genus, <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis is enriched in host-associated species compared to environment-associated species. These findings identify cobamides as a potential mediator of skin microbiome dynamics and skin health.

Burn injury promotes an excessive activation of the cutaneous and systemic immune response directed against commensal and invading pathogens. Skin grafting is the primary method of reconstructing full-thickness burns, and wound infection continues to be a significant complication.<h4>Methods</h4>In this study, the cutaneous bacterial microbiome was evaluated and subsequently compared to patient outcomes. Three different full-thickness skin specimens were assessed: control skin from non-burned subjects; burn margin from burn patients; and autologous donor skin from the same cohort of burn patients.<h4>Results</h4>We observed that skin bacterial community structure of burn patients was significantly altered compared with control patients. We determined that the unburned autologous donor skin from burn patients exhibits a microbiome similar to that of the burn margin, rather than unburned controls, and that changes in the cutaneous microbiome statistically correlate with several post-burn complications. We established that Corynebacterium positively correlated with burn wound infection, while Staphylococcus and Propionibacterium negatively correlated with burn wound infection. Both Corynebacterium and Enterococcus negatively correlated with the development of sepsis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study identifies distinct differences in the cutaneous microbiome between burn subjects and unburned controls, and ascertains that select bacterial taxa significantly correlate with several comorbid complications of burn injury. These preliminary data suggest that grafting donor skin exhibiting bacterial dysbiosis may augment infection and/or graft failure and sets the foundation for more in-depth and mechanistic analyses in presumably ""healthy"" donor skin from patients requiring skin grafting procedures."	*Burn and Shock Trauma Research Institute, Loyola University Chicago, Health Sciences Campus, Maywood, Illinois†Department of Surgery, Loyola University Chicago, Health Sciences Campus, Maywood, Illinois‡Department of Public Health Sciences, Stritch School of Medicine, Loyola University Chicago, Health Sciences Campus, Maywood, Illinois§Center for Biomedical Informatics, Loyola University Chicago, Health Sciences Campus, Maywood, Illinois||Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana¶Departments of Dermatology and Microbiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.	ppublish	eng	Print	Clinical Trial;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't;research-article;Journal Article;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural		N	Y	N	Y	N	N	13	Y	Y	Y	N	Y		Y	bioproject	2017-04-04	2017-04-04	2020-10-21	2022-03-18		2017-10-01	https://doi.org/10.1097/shk.0000000000000874	https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5603347	https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5603347?pdf=render

TaxPhlAn can be applied to any group of phylogenetically-related bacteria, provided reference genomes are available. As TaxPhlAn requires the SLST targets identified to fit the phylogenetic pattern as determined through comprehensive evolutionary reconstruction of input genomes, TaxPhlAn allows for the identification and phylogenetic inference of new biodiversity. Here, we present a clinically relevant case study of high-resolution Staphylococcus profiling on skin of atopic dermatitis (AD) patients. We demonstrate that SLST enables profiling of cutaneous Staphylococcus members at (sub)species level and provides higher resolution than current 16S-based techniques. With the higher discriminative ability provided by our approach, we further show that the presence of Staphylococcus capitis on the skin together with Staphylococcus aureus associates with AD disease.

Yet, clinical observations report that patients with AN do not suffer from infectious skin diseases like those associated with primary malnutrition. Cell-mediated immunity appears to be amplified in AN; however, this proinflammatory state does not sufficiently explain the lower incidence of infections. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are important components of the innate immune system protecting from pathogens and shaping the microbiota. In Drosophila melanogaster starvation precedes increased AMP gene expression. Here, we analyzed skin microbiota in patients with AN and age-matched, healthy-weight controls and investigated the influence of weight gain on microbial community structure. We then correlated features of the skin microbial community with psoriasin and RNase 7, two highly abundant AMPs in human skin, to clarify whether an association between AMPs and skin microbiota exists and whether such a relationship might contribute to the resistance to cutaneous infections observed in AN. We find significant statistical correlations between Shannon diversity and the highly abundant skin AMP psoriasin and bacterial load, respectively. Moreover, we reveal psoriasin significantly associates with Abiotrophia, an indicator for the healthy-weight control group. Additionally, we observe a significant correlation between an individual's body mass index and Lactobacillus, a microbial indicator of health. Future investigation may help clarify physiological mechanisms that link nutritional intake with skin physiology.

Healthy skin microbial communities are dominated by bacteria with low viral representation<sup>1-3</sup>, mainly bacteriophage. Specific eukaryotic viruses have been implicated in both common and rare skin diseases, but cataloging skin viral communities has been limited. Alterations in host immunity provide an opportunity to expand our understanding of microbial-host interactions. Primary immunodeficient patients manifest with various viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections, including skin infections<sup>4</sup>. Dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) deficiency is a rare primary human immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent cutaneous and systemic infections, as well as atopy and cancer susceptibility<sup>5</sup>. DOCK8, encoding a guanine nucleotide exchange factor highly expressed in lymphocytes, regulates actin cytoskeleton, which is critical for migration through collagen-dense tissues such as skin<sup>6</sup>. Analyzing deep metagenomic sequencing data from DOCK8-deficient skin samples demonstrated a notable increase in eukaryotic viral representation and diversity compared with healthy volunteers. De novo assembly approaches identified hundreds of novel human papillomavirus genomes, illuminating microbial dark matter. Expansion of the skin virome in DOCK8-deficient patients underscores the importance of immune surveillance in controlling eukaryotic viral colonization and infection.

Previous culture-based studies have found staphylococci, streptococci, and opportunistic pathogenic bacteria in LCL lesions, but there have been no comparisons to normal skin. In addition, this approach has strong bias for determining bacterial composition. The present study tested the hypothesis that bacterial communities in LCL lesions differ from those found on healthy skin (HS). Using a high throughput amplicon sequencing approach, which allows for better populational evaluation due to greater depth coverage and the Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology pipeline, we compared the microbiological signature of LCL lesions with that of contralateral HS from the same individuals.Streptococcus, Staphylococcus,Fusobacterium and other strict or facultative anaerobic bacteria composed the LCL microbiome. Aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria found in HS, including environmental bacteria, were significantly decreased in LCL lesions (p < 0.01). This paper presents the first comprehensive microbiome identification from LCL lesions with next generation sequence methodology and shows a marked reduction of bacterial diversity in the lesions.

Many tools reduce, summarize, and visualize these high-dimensional data to provide insight at the community level. However, they lose the detailed information about each taxon and can be misleading (for example, the well-known horseshoe effect in ordination plots). Thus, multiple methods at different levels of resolution are required to capture the full range of microbial patterns. Here we present Calour, a user-friendly data exploration tool for microbiome analyses. Calour provides a study-centric data model to store and manipulate sample-by-feature tables (with features typically being operational taxonomic units) and their associated metadata. It generates an interactive heatmap, allowing visualization of microbial patterns and exploration using microbial knowledge databases. We demonstrate the use of Calour by exploring publicly available data sets, including the gut and skin microbiota of habitat-switched fire salamander larvae, gut microbiota of Trichuris muris-infected mice, skin microbiota of different human body sites, gut microbiota of various ant species, and a metabolome study of mice exposed to intermittent hypoxia and hypercapnia. In these cases, Calour reveals novel patterns and potential contaminants of subgroups of microbes that are otherwise hard to find. Calour is open source under the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) license and available from https://github.com/biocore/calour. IMPORTANCE Calour allows us to identify interesting microbial patterns and generate novel biological hypotheses by interactively inspecting microbiome studies and incorporating annotation databases and convenient statistical tools. Calour can be used as a first-step tool for microbiome data exploration.

In addition, C-sections operations are performed in ORs that provide the first environment and bacterial exposure to the sterile newborns that are extracted directly from the uterus to the OR air. Considering that at least one third of neonates in the US are born via C-section delivery (and more than 50% of all deliveries in some countries), understanding the distribution of bacterial diversity in ORs is critical to better understanding the contribution of the OR microbiota to C-section- associated inflammatory diseases. Here, we mapped the bacteria contained in an OR after a procedure was performed; we sampled grids of 60x60 cm across walls and wall-adjacent floors and sequenced the V4 region of 16S rRNA gene from 260 samples. The results indicate that bacterial communities changed significantly (ANOSIM, p-value < 0.001) with wall height, with an associated reduction of alpha diversity (t-test, p-value <0.05). OR walls contained high proportions of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria, with Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes being the highest in floors and lowest in the highest wall sites. Members of Firmicutes, Deinococcus-thermus, and Actinobacteria increased with wall height. Source-track analysis estimate that human skin is the major source contributing to bacterial composition in the OR walls, with an increase of bacteria related to human feces in the lowest walls and airborne bacteria in the highest wall sites. The results show that bacterial exposure in ORs varies spatially, and evidence exposure of C-section born neonates to human bacteria that remain on the floors and walls, possibly accumulated from patients, health, and cleaning staff.

The microbial residents of the skin are now appreciated for their roles in host immune interactions, wound healing, colonization resistance, and various skin disorders. Still, much remains to be discovered in terms of the host pathways influenced by skin microorganisms, as well as the higher-level skin properties impacted through these microbe-host interactions. Towards this direction, recent efforts using mouse models point to pronounced changes in the transcriptional profiles of the skin in response to the presence of a microbial community. However, there is a need to quantify the roles of microorganisms at both the individual and community-level in healthy human skin. In this study, we utilize human skin equivalents to study the effects of individual taxa and a microbial community in a precisely controlled context. Through transcriptomics analysis, we identify key genes and pathways influenced by skin microbes, and we also characterize higher-level impacts on skin processes and properties through histological analyses.<h4>Results</h4>The presence of a microbiome on a 3D skin tissue model led to significantly altered patterns of gene expression, influencing genes involved in the regulation of apoptosis, proliferation, and the extracellular matrix (among others). Moreover, microbiome treatment influenced the thickness of the epidermal layer, reduced the number of actively proliferating cells, and increased filaggrin expression. Many of these findings were evident upon treatment with the mixed community, but either not detected or less pronounced in treatments by single microorganisms, underscoring the impact that a diverse skin microbiome has on the host.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This work contributes to the understanding of how microbiome constituents individually and collectively influence human skin processes and properties. The results show that, while it is important to understand the effect of individual microbes on the host, a full community of microbes has unique and pronounced effects on the skin. Thus, in its impacts on the host, the skin microbiome is more than the sum of its parts. Video abstract.

A subset of samples was tested for the presence of HPV DNA. High-quality, non-human reads from each sample group were used for viral analysis using Microbiome Coverage Profiler.<h4>Results</h4>None of the samples analysed had detectable expression of HPV RNA, while 64% of samples tested positive for HPV DNA. All samples were found to have expression of human endogenous retrovirus, and multiple samples showed expression of other viruses.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Viral and prophage gene expression can be monitored in cuSCC or normal skin biopsies, yet no sample in our study showed evidence of active HPV gene expression despite evidence of HPV genome presence. This suggests HPV transcription does not play a role in differentiating high-risk cuSCCs from low-risk cuSCCs or normal skin.

Although CTCL is thought to arise from a combination of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors, specific triggers are unclear. The skin is colonized by a unique microbiota and is heavily influenced by its interactions. We hypothesized that adaptive immune responses to skin commensals lead to clonal T-cell proliferation and transformation in the appropriate genetic background. We therefore collected lesional and nonlesional skin microbiota from patients with CTCL to study T cell interactions using skin T cell explants and peripheral, skin-homing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. By various methods, we identified <i>Bacillus safensis</i> in CTCL lesions, a rare human commensal in healthy skin, and showed that it can induce malignant T cell activation and cytokine secretion. Taken together, our data suggest microbial triggers in the skin microbiota of patients with CTCL as potential instigators of tumorigenesis.

Compared to culture-based techniques, DNA sequencing of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene or whole metagenome shotgun (WMS) sequencing provides more precise microbial community characterizations. Most widely used protocols were developed to characterize microbiota of other habitats (i.e., gastrointestinal) and have not been systematically compared for their utility in skin microbiome surveys. Here we establish a resource for the cutaneous research community to guide experimental design in characterizing skin microbiota. We compare two widely sequenced regions of the 16S rRNA gene to WMS sequencing for recapitulating skin microbiome community composition, diversity, and genetic functional enrichment. We show that WMS sequencing most accurately recapitulates microbial communities, but sequencing of hypervariable regions 1-3 of the 16S rRNA gene provides highly similar results. Sequencing of hypervariable region 4 poorly captures skin commensal microbiota, especially Propionibacterium. WMS sequencing, which is resource and cost intensive, provides evidence of a community's functional potential; however, metagenome predictions based on 16S rRNA sequence tags closely approximate WMS genetic functional profiles. This study highlights the importance of experimental design for downstream results in skin microbiome surveys.

A diverse microbiome exists on human skin and has a potential to influence pathogenic microbes and modulate the course of skin disorders, e.g. atopic dermatitis. In addition to the known dysfunctions in barrier function of the skin and immunologic disturbances, evidence is rising that frequent skin disorders, e.g. atopic dermatitis, might be connected to a dysbiosis of the microbial community and changes in the skin microbiome. As a future perspective, examining the skin microbiome could be seen as a potential new diagnostic and therapeutic target in inflammatory skin disorders.

To explore these factors' contribution to skin microbial community stability, we generated metagenomic sequence data from longitudinal samples collected over months and years. Analyzing these samples using a multi-kingdom, reference-based approach, we found that despite the skin's exposure to the external environment, its bacterial, fungal, and viral communities were largely stable over time. Site, individuality, and phylogeny were all determinants of stability. Foot sites exhibited the most variability; individuals differed in stability; and transience was a particular characteristic of eukaryotic viruses, which showed little site-specificity in colonization. Strain and single-nucleotide variant-level analysis showed that individuals maintain, rather than reacquire, prevalent microbes from the environment. Longitudinal stability of skin microbial communities generates hypotheses about colonization resistance and empowers clinical studies exploring alterations observed in disease states.

This study examined changes in the skin microbiome of parapsoriasis compared with intact skin. Swab microbiome specimens were taken of the parapsoriasis lesions of 13 patients. Control samples were taken from contralateral healthy sides of the body. Microbiotas were characterized by sequencing the V1-V3 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA bacterial genes on the Illumina MiSeq platform. The most common genera in the microbiome data were Propionibacterium (27.13%), Corynebacterium (21.20%) and Staphylococcus (4.63%). Out of the Staphylococcus sequences, 39.6% represented S. epidermidis, with the rest including S. hominis, S. capitis and unidentified species. No significant differences were observed between the patients' parapsoriasis and contralateral healthy skin or between large- and small-plaque parapsoriasis. Notable interpersonal variation was demonstrated. These results suggest that parapsoriasis is not associated with significant alterations in the cutaneous bacterial microbiome.

The harsh physical landscape of skin, particularly the desiccated, nutrient-poor, acidic environment, also contributes to the adversity that pathogens face when colonizing human skin. Despite this, the skin is colonized by a diverse microbiota. In this Review, we describe amplicon and shotgun metagenomic DNA sequencing studies that have been used to assess the taxonomic diversity of microorganisms that are associated with skin from the kingdom to the strain level. We discuss recent insights into skin microbial communities, including their composition in health and disease, the dynamics between species and interactions with the immune system, with a focus on Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus.

Biomarkers can predict the onset of dementing illness, but also correlate with cognition in a dynamic way allowing us to follow treatment responses and determine brain recovery. Chronic HIV infection causes cognitive impairment in a subset of individuals suggesting ""premature aging."" Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles that are shed from all cells. They are important in normal cell-to-cell communication as they contain cellular proteins, mRNA transcripts, and miRNAs. Exosome cargo varies depending on the health of the cell and pathological state; specific proteins/mRNAs and/or miRNAs are present and may serve as biomarkers. Exosomes of variable cellular origin can be isolated from peripheral blood by various methods. Neuron-derived exosomes (NDEs) can be isolated using a precipitation/immunoaffinity approach using antibodies against neuronal cell adhesion molecule L1CAM and the contents queried for central nervous system (CNS) disorders including HIV-associated neurological disorders (HAND) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). As these studies are recent, numerous questions arise including which neuronal proteins are in NDEs and whether their contents differ in different CNS pathologies or with age. In addition, can the NDE cargo predict as well as diagnose cognitive impairment and could exosomal contents be used as therapeutic biomarkers, or theramarkers, of neuronal recovery from effective treatment? This mini-review will show some new data and review recent studies on NDE from individuals with HIV infection and AD. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) are pathologies seen in a subset of individuals with chronic HIV infection. They belong to the spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases that result in death or dysfunction of neurons with similarities to Alzheimer disease (AD) but also distinctive differences (reviewed (Canet et al., Front Cell Neurosci 12: 307, 2018)). Both disorders are difficult to diagnose without neuropsychological testing and both need new biomarkers to judge progression as well as recovery with treatment. Both disorders involve neuroinflammation and several common targets. AD is associated with aging and HIV is thought to initiate premature aging. In HIV infection, amyloid beta (Aβ), which is deposited in ""plaques"" in AD, is soluble and its relevance to HIV-associated cognitive impairment is controversial (Achim et al., J Neuroimmune Pharmacol 4: 190-199, 2009; Rempel and Pulliam, AIDS 19: 127-135, 2005). Aβ deposition is required for AD pathological diagnosis, but is not necessarily causative (Barage and Sonawane, Neuropeptides 52: 1-18, 2015; Hardy and Selkoe, Science 297: 353-356, 2002; Morris et al., Acta Neuropathol Commun 2: 135, 2014). Neurofilament light (NF-L) is a surrogate marker in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for neurodegeneration (Abu-Rumeileh et al., Alzheimers Res Ther 10: 3, 2018; Mattsson et al., JAMA Neurol 74: 557-566, 2017) but continues to be a controversial biomarker for both HAND and AD (Gisslen et al., EBioMedicine 3: 135-140, 2016; Kovacs et al., Eur J Neurol 24:1326-e77, 2017; Norgren et al., Brain Res 987: 25-31, 2003; Rolstad et al., J Alzheimers Dis 45: 873-881, 2015; Yilmaz et al., Expert Rev Mol Diagn 17: 761-770, 2017). Blood biomarkers are needed to advance both HAND and AD fields, as blood draws are less costly than neuroimaging and are minimally invasive compared to lumbar punctures required for CSF acquisition. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanoscale membranous vesicles shed from all cells including those of the central nervous system (CNS) and found in all biofluids; they are divided into exosomes (30-150 nm) originating from late endosomes/multivesicular bodies and microvesicles (150-1000 nm) produced through budding of the plasma membrane. Both types of vesicles are implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and may provide biomarkers (Bellingham et al., Front Physiol 3: 124, 2012). In this report, we call the vesicles exosomes, since they are the predominant vesicles in our preparations. They are involved in cell-to-cell communication in normal homeostasis and can be carriers of toxic proteins (Aβ, tau) (Sardar Sinha et al., Acta Neuropathol 136: 41-56, 2018) shed by cells as waste or actively secreted in a degenerative process (review Gupta and Pulliam, J Neuroinflammation 11: 68, 2014). The idea that exosomes originating from a specific cell can be recovered in the plasma using cellular surface markers of interest is intriguing. Neuron derived exosomes (NDEs) were first described in 2015 and isolated using antibodies against neural cell adhesion molecules NCAM or L1CAM, after total plasma exosome isolation (Fiandaca et al., Alzheimers Dement 11: 600-607 e1, 2015). Characterization of NDEs follows guidelines endorsed by the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles and includes Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) to determine EV concentration and average diameter; Western Blots for EV markers; ELISAs for neuronal proteins and transmission EM for visualization (Sun et al., AIDS 31: F9-F17, 2017; Tang et al., FASEB J 30: 3097-106, 2016). This innovative isolation of an exosome sub-population has generated interest in using NDE as biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases like AD, HAND, traumatic brain injury, posttraumatic stress disorder and more (reviews Agoston et al., Brain Inj 31: 1195-1203, 2017; Gupta and Pulliam, J Neuroinflammation 11: 68, 2014; Hu et al., Cell Death Dis 7: e2481, 2016; Karnati et al., J Neurotrauma, 2018; Osier et al., Mol Neurobiol, 2018). Several biomarkers from plasma NDEs were recently reported by the Pulliam lab to be elevated in general cognitive impairment (Sun et al., AIDS 31: F9-F17, 2017). We review our collective data here on HAND and AD and add to the characterization of plasma NDEs as exciting biomarkers of neurodegeneration."

The past decade has been marked by an increased interest in the skin microbiota and its role in cutaneous health and disease, in part due to advances in next-generation sequencing platforms that enable high-throughput, culture-independent detection of bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Various approaches, including bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and metagenomic shotgun sequencing, have been applied to profile microbial communities colonizing healthy skin and diseased skin including atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and acne, among others. Here, we provide an overview of culture-dependent and -independent approaches to profiling the skin microbiota and the types of questions that may be answered by each approach.

Here, we demonstrate that malignant T cell lines derived from CTCL patients as well as primary malignant CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from Sézary syndrome patients are considerably more resistant to alpha-toxin-induced cell death than their non-malignant counterparts. Thus, in a subset of Sézary syndrome patients the ratio between malignant and non-malignant CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells increases significantly following exposure to alpha-toxin. Whereas toxin-induced cell death is ADAM10 dependent in healthy CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, resistance to alpha-toxin in malignant T cells involves both downregulation of ADAM10 as well as other resistance mechanisms. In conclusion, we provide first evidence that <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> derived alpha-toxin can tilt the balance between malignant and non-malignant CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in CTCL patients. Consequently, alpha-toxin may promote disease progression through positive selection of malignant CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, identifying alpha-toxin as a putative drug target in CTCL.

Here, we examined the roles of dermal cDC1s and cDC2s during bacterial infection, notably Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes). cDC1s, but not cDC2s, regulated the magnitude of the immune response to P. acnes in the murine dermis by controlling neutrophil recruitment to the inflamed site and survival and function therein. Single-cell mRNA sequencing revealed that this regulation relied on secretion of the cytokine vascular endothelial growth factor α (VEGF-α) by a minor subset of activated EpCAM+CD59+Ly-6D+ cDC1s. Neutrophil recruitment by dermal cDC1s was also observed during S. aureus, bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), or E. coli infection, as well as in a model of bacterial insult in human skin. Thus, skin cDC1s are essential regulators of the innate response in cutaneous immunity and have roles beyond classical antigen presentation.

Polymicrobial biofilms in the wound bed are hypothesized to disrupt the highly coordinated and sequential events of cutaneous healing. Both culture-dependent and -independent studies of the chronic-wound microbiome have almost exclusively focused on bacteria, omitting what we hypothesize are important fungal contributions to impaired healing and the development of complications. Here we show for the first time that fungal communities (the mycobiome) in chronic wounds are predictive of healing time, associated with poor outcomes, and form mixed fungal-bacterial biofilms. We longitudinally profiled 100, nonhealing diabetic-foot ulcers with high-throughput sequencing of the pan-fungal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) locus, estimating that up to 80% of wounds contain fungi, whereas cultures performed in parallel captured only 5% of colonized wounds. The ""mycobiome"" was highly heterogeneous over time and between subjects. Fungal diversity increased with antibiotic administration and onset of a clinical complication. The proportions of the phylum Ascomycota were significantly greater (P = 0.015) at the beginning of the study in wounds that took >8 weeks to heal. Wound necrosis was distinctly associated with pathogenic fungal species, while taxa identified as allergenic filamentous fungi were associated with low levels of systemic inflammation. Directed culturing of wounds stably colonized by pathogens revealed that interkingdom biofilms formed between yeasts and coisolated bacteria. Combined, our analyses provide enhanced resolution of the mycobiome during impaired wound healing, its role in chronic disease, and impact on clinical outcomes. Wounds are an underappreciated but serious complication for a diverse spectrum of diseases. High-risk groups, such as persons with diabetes, have a 25% lifetime risk of developing a wound that can become chronic. The majority of microbiome research related to chronic wounds is focused on bacteria, but the association of fungi with clinical outcomes remains to be elucidated. Here we describe the dynamic fungal communities in 100 diabetic patients with foot ulcers. We found that communities are unstable over time, but at the first clinical presentation, the relative proportions of different phyla predict healing times. Pathogenic fungi not identified by culture reside in necrotic wounds and are associated with a poor prognosis. In wounds stably colonized by fungi, we identified yeasts capable of forming biofilms in concert with bacteria. Our findings illuminate the associations of the fungal mycobiome with wound prognosis and healing."

We developed a model in which human volunteers are infected on the upper arm with <i>H. ducreyi</i> until they develop pustules. To define the <i>H. ducreyi</i> and human interactome, we determined bacterial and host transcriptomic and host metabolomic changes in pustules. We found that <i>in vivo</i><i>H. ducreyi</i> transcripts were distinct from those in the inocula, as were host transcripts in pustule and wounded control sites. Many of the upregulated <i>H. ducreyi</i> genes were found to be involved in ascorbic acid and anaerobic metabolism and inorganic ion/nutrient transport. The top 20 significantly expressed human pathways showed that all were involved in immune responses. We generated a bipartite network for interactions between host and bacterial gene transcription; multiple positively correlated networks contained <i>H. ducreyi</i> genes involved in anaerobic metabolism and host genes involved with the immune response. Metabolomic studies showed that pustule and wounded samples had different metabolite compositions; the top ion pathway involved ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, which correlated with the <i>H. ducreyi</i> transcriptional response and upregulation of host genes involved in ascorbic acid recycling. These data show that an interactome exists between <i>H. ducreyi</i> and the human host and suggest that <i>H. ducreyi</i> exploits the metabolic niche created by the host immune response.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Dual RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) offers the promise of determining an interactome at a transcriptional level between a bacterium and the host but has yet to be done on any bacterial infection in human tissue. We performed dual RNA-seq and metabolomics analyses on wounded and infected sites following experimental infection of the arm with <i>H. ducreyi</i> Our results suggest that <i>H. ducreyi</i> survives in an abscess by utilizing l-ascorbate as an alternative carbon source, possibly taking advantage of host ascorbic acid recycling, and that <i>H. ducreyi</i> also adapts by upregulating genes involved in anaerobic metabolism and inorganic ion and nutrient transport. To our knowledge, this is the first description of an interaction network between a bacterium and the human host at a site of infection.

Haemophilus ducreyi causes cutaneous ulcers in children and the genital ulcer disease chancroid in adults. We developed a human challenge model in which healthy adult volunteers are infected with H. ducreyi on the upper arm until they develop pustules. Here, we characterized host-pathogen interactions in pustules using transcriptomics and metabolomics and examined interactions between the host transcriptome and metabolome using integrated omics. In a previous pilot study, we determined the human and H. ducreyi transcriptomes and the metabolome of pustule and wounded sites of 4 volunteers (B. Griesenauer, T. M. Tran, K. R. Fortney, D. M. Janowicz, et al., mBio 10:e01193-19, 2019, https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.01193-19). While we could form provisional transcriptional networks between the host and H. ducreyi, the study was underpowered to integrate the metabolome with the host transcriptome. To better define and integrate the transcriptomes and metabolome, we used samples from both the pilot study (<i>n</i> = 4) and new volunteers (<i>n</i> = 8) to identify 5,495 human differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 123 H. ducreyi DEGs, 205 differentially abundant positive ions, and 198 differentially abundant negative ions. We identified 42 positively correlated and 29 negatively correlated human-H. ducreyi transcriptome clusters. In addition, we defined human transcriptome-metabolome networks consisting of 9 total clusters, which highlighted changes in fatty acid metabolism and mitigation of oxidative damage. Taken together, the data suggest a mixed pro- and anti-inflammatory environment and rewired central metabolism in the host that provides a hostile, nutrient-limited environment for H. ducreyi. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Interactions between the host and bacteria at sites of infection in humans are poorly understood. We inoculated human volunteers on the upper arm with the skin pathogen H. ducreyi or a buffer control and biopsied the resulting infected and sham-inoculated sites. We performed dual transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) and metabolic analysis on the biopsy samples. Network analyses between the host and bacterial transcriptomes and the host transcriptome-metabolome network were used to identify molecules that may be important for the virulence of H. ducreyi in the human host. Our results suggest that the pustule is highly oxidative, contains both pro- and anti-inflammatory components, and causes metabolic shifts in the host, to which H. ducreyi adapts to survive. To our knowledge, this is the first study to integrate transcriptomic and metabolomic responses to a single bacterial pathogen in the human host.

On average, 29.5% and 42.7% CD patients experience perianal complications at 10 and 20 y after diagnosis, respectively. Perianal CD (pCD) result in high disease burden, diminished quality of life, and elevated health-care costs. Overall pCD are predictors of poor long-term outcomes. Animal models of gut inflammation have failed to fully recapitulate the human manifestations of fistulizing CD. Here, we evaluated dogs with spontaneous canine anal furunculosis (CAF), a disease with clinical similarities to pCD, as a surrogate model for understanding the microbial contribution of human pCD pathophysiology. By comparing the gut microbiomes between dogs suffering from CAF (CAF dogs) and healthy dogs, we show CAF-dog microbiomes are either very dissimilar (dysbiotic) or similar (healthy-like), yet unique, to healthy dog's microbiomes. Compared to healthy or healthy-like CAF microbiomes, dysbiotic CAF microbiomes showed an increased abundance of <i>Bacteroides vulgatus</i> and <i>Escherichia coli</i> and a decreased abundance of <i>Megamonas</i> species and <i>Prevotella copri</i>. Our results mirror what have been reported in previous microbiome studies of patients with CD; particularly, CAF dogs exhibited two distinct microbiome composition: dysbiotic and healthy-like, with determinant bacterial taxa such as <i>E. coli</i> and <i>P. copri</i> that overlap what it has been found on their human counterpart. Thus, our results support the use of CAF dogs as a surrogate model to advance our understanding of microbial dynamics in pCD.

Transcriptomic analyses have previously been performed from bulk skin samples or from epithelial and immune cells expanded in cell culture. However, transcriptomic analysis of bulk skin tends to drown out expression signals from relatively rare cells while cell culture methods may significantly alter cellular phenotypes and gene expression profiles. To identify distinct transcriptomic profiles of multiple cell populations without substantially altering cell phenotypes, we employed a fluorescence activated cell sorting method to isolate keratinocytes, dendritic cells, CD4+ T effector cells, and CD8+ T effector cells from healthy skin samples, followed by RNA-seq of each cell population. Principal components analysis revealed distinct clustering of cell types across samples, while differential expression and coexpression network analyses revealed transcriptional profiles of individual cell populations distinct from bulk skin, most strikingly in the least abundant CD8+ T effector population. Our work provides a high resolution view of cutaneous cellular gene expression and suggests that transcriptomic profiling of bulk skin may inadequately capture the contribution of less abundant cell types.

But, for some volcanoes, uplift of metres or more has not yet led to an eruption. Here we present displacement maps of volcanoes in the Galápagos Islands, constructed using satellite radar interferometry, that might help explain this dichotomy. We show that all but one of the seven volcanoes on the islands of Isabela and Fernandina deformed during 1992-99. Cerro Azul and Fernandina erupted during the observation period and show evidence of inflation, co-eruptive deflation and shallow dyke intrusion. In contrast, the largest volcano, Sierra Negra, has not erupted, yet exhibits spatially and temporally variable deformation, with a maximum uplift of 2.7 m between 1992 and 1999, which can be modelled by a shallow inflating sill. Inflation during 1997-98, however, was accompanied by 'trapdoor' faulting on a steeply dipping fracture system within the caldera. Repeated trapdoor faulting over geological time has formed an arcuate intra-caldera ridge within Sierra Negra and may have acted to relax stresses above the magma chamber, inhibiting summit eruptions. Similar processes may help explain large uplift unaccompanied by eruptive activity at other volcanoes.

However, the interactions between keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation status and the skin microbiome have not been fully explored.<h4>Objectives</h4>Hypothesizing that the skin microbiome contributes to regulation of keratinocyte differentiation and can modify antimicrobial responses, we examined the effect of exposure to commensal (Staphylococcus epidermidis, SE) or pathogenic (Staphylococcus aureus, SA) challenge on epidermal models.<h4>Methods</h4>Explant biopsies were taken to investigate species-specific antimicrobial effects of host factors. Further investigations were performed in reconstituted epidermal models by bulk transcriptomic analysis alongside secreted protein profiling. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis was performed to explore the keratinocyte populations responsible for SA inflammation. A dataset of 6391 keratinocytes from control (2044 cells), SE challenge (2028 cells) and SA challenge (2319 cells) was generated from reconstituted epidermal models.<h4>Results</h4>Bacterial lawns of SA, not SE, were inhibited by human skin explant samples, and microarray analysis of three-dimensional epidermis models showed that host antimicrobial peptide expression was induced by SE but not SA. Protein analysis of bacterial cocultured models showed that SA exposure induced inflammatory mediator expression, indicating keratinocyte activation of other epidermal immune populations. Single-cell DropSeq analysis of unchallenged naive, SE-challenged and SA-challenged epidermis models was undertaken to distinguish cells from basal, spinous and granular layers, and to interrogate them in relation to model exposure. In contrast to SE, SA specifically induced a subpopulation of spinous cells that highly expressed transcripts related to epidermal inflammation and antimicrobial response. Furthermore, SA, but not SE, specifically induced a basal population that highly expressed interleukin-1 alarmins.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These findings suggest that SA-associated remodelling of the epidermis is compartmentalized to different keratinocyte populations. Elucidating the mechanisms regulating bacterial sensing-triggered inflammatory responses within tissues will enable further understanding of microbiome dysbiosis and inflammatory skin diseases, such as atopic eczema.

In amphibians, infectious diseases have been closely associated with population decline and extinction worldwide. Skin symbiont communities have been suggested as one of the factors driving the different susceptibilities of amphibians to diseases. The activity of the skin microbiota of amphibians against fungal pathogens, such as Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, has been examined extensively, whereas its protective role towards the cutaneous infectious diseases caused by Amphibiocystidium parasites has not yet been elucidated in detail. In the present study, we investigated, for the first time, the cutaneous microbiota of the Italian stream frog (Rana italica) and characterized the microbial assemblages of frogs uninfected and infected by Amphibiocystidium using the Illumina next-generation sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments. A total of 629 different OTUs belonging to 16 different phyla were detected. Bacterial populations shared by all individuals represented only one fifth of all OTUs and were dominated by a small number of OTUs. Statistical analyses based on Bray-Curtis distances showed that uninfected and infected specimens had distinct cutaneous bacterial community structures. Phylotypes belonging to the genera Janthinobacterium, Pseudomonas, and Flavobacterium were more abundant, and sometimes almost exclusively present, in uninfected than in infected specimens. These bacterial populations, known to exhibit antifungal activity in amphibians, may also play a role in protection against cutaneous infectious diseases caused by Amphibiocystidium parasites.

Viral communities have the potential to modulate states of cutaneous health and disease. Bacteriophages are known to influence the structure and function of microbial communities through predation and genetic exchange. Human viruses are associated with skin cancers and a multitude of cutaneous manifestations. Despite these important roles, little is known regarding the human skin virome and its interactions with the host microbiome. Here we evaluated the human cutaneous double-stranded DNA virome by metagenomic sequencing of DNA from purified virus-like particles (VLPs). In parallel, we employed metagenomic sequencing of the total skin microbiome to assess covariation and infer interactions with the virome. Samples were collected from 16 subjects at eight body sites over 1 month. In addition to the microenviroment, which is known to partition the bacterial and fungal microbiota, natural skin occlusion was strongly associated with skin virome community composition. Viral contigs were enriched for genes indicative of a temperate phage replication style and also maintained genes encoding potential antibiotic resistance and virulence factors. CRISPR spacers identified in the bacterial DNA sequences provided a record of phage predation and suggest a mechanism to explain spatial partitioning of skin phage communities. Finally, we modeled the structure of bacterial and phage communities together to reveal a complex microbial environment with a Corynebacterium hub. These results reveal the previously underappreciated diversity, encoded functions, and viral-microbial dynamic unique to the human skin virome. IMPORTANCE:To date, most cutaneous microbiome studies have focused on bacterial and fungal communities. Skin viral communities and their relationships with their hosts remain poorly understood despite their potential to modulate states of cutaneous health and disease. Previous studies employing whole-metagenome sequencing without purification for virus-like particles (VLPs) have provided some insight into the viral component of the skin microbiome but have not completely characterized these communities or analyzed interactions with the host microbiome. Here we present an optimized virus purification technique and corresponding analysis tools for gaining novel insights into the skin virome, including viral ""dark matter,"" and its potential interactions with the host microbiome. The work presented here establishes a baseline of the healthy human skin virome and is a necessary foundation for future studies examining viral perturbations in skin health and disease."

Compared to culture-based techniques, DNA sequencing of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene or whole metagenome shotgun (WMS) sequencing provides more precise microbial community characterizations. Most widely used protocols were developed to characterize microbiota of other habitats (i.e., gastrointestinal) and have not been systematically compared for their utility in skin microbiome surveys. Here we establish a resource for the cutaneous research community to guide experimental design in characterizing skin microbiota. We compare two widely sequenced regions of the 16S rRNA gene to WMS sequencing for recapitulating skin microbiome community composition, diversity, and genetic functional enrichment. We show that WMS sequencing most accurately recapitulates microbial communities, but sequencing of hypervariable regions 1-3 of the 16S rRNA gene provides highly similar results. Sequencing of hypervariable region 4 poorly captures skin commensal microbiota, especially Propionibacterium. WMS sequencing, which is resource and cost intensive, provides evidence of a community's functional potential; however, metagenome predictions based on 16S rRNA sequence tags closely approximate WMS genetic functional profiles. This study highlights the importance of experimental design for downstream results in skin microbiome surveys.

Here we show that acute exposure to antiseptic treatments elicits rapid but short-term depletion of microbial community diversity and membership. Thirteen subjects were enrolled in a longitudinal treatment study to analyze the effects of topical treatments (i.e., ethanol, povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine, and water) on the skin microbiome at two skin sites of disparate microenvironment: forearm and back. Treatment effects were highly dependent on personalized and body site-specific colonization signatures, which concealed community dynamics at the population level when not accounted for in this analysis. The magnitude of disruption was influenced by the identity and abundance of particular bacterial inhabitants. Lowly abundant members of the skin microbiota were more likely to be displaced, and subsequently replaced, by the most abundant taxa prior to treatment. Members of the skin commensal family Propionibactericeae were particularly resilient to treatment, suggesting a distinct competitive advantage in the face of disturbance. These results provide insight into the stability and resilience of the skin microbiome, while establishing the impact of topical antiseptic treatment on skin bacterial dynamics and community ecology.

Our objective was to determine daily changes in skin microbiome profiles up to 72h postchlorhexidine treatment. Left and right forearm skin swab samples were obtained from 10 healthy volunteers over 72h at 24h intervals. Dorsal surface of left arm was treated with chlorohexidine gluconate (CHG) at initial time point (T = 0), while the right arm remained untreated (control). Swab samples were obtained shortly before (T = 0) and after CHG treatment (T = 24-48-72h). Bacterial DNA extraction, 16S rRNA gene V1-V3 sequencing and taxonomic annotation were performed using ZymoBIOMICS pipeline. PERMANOVA, linear discriminant and bacterial interaction network analyses were performed. A total of 13 total phyla, 273 genera, and 950 total species were detected across all time points, CHG-treated or CHG-untreated. Most abundant species included Cutibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Rothia Mucilaginosa. Low biomass-related inconsistent taxa detection was observed. PERMANOVA suggested a marginal difference between CHG-treated and CHG-untreated microbiome profiles (Genera: P(perm) = 0.0531; Species: P(perm) = 0.0450). Bacterial interaction network guided PERMANOVA analyses detected a microbiome change over time, suggesting a consistent CHG treatment-specific change. LEfSe identified Finegoldia magna, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus thermoamylovorans as the only distinctive species. These species were more abundant and/or present post-CHG treatment in the CHG-treated group. These findings suggest that the skin microbiome was not significantly different 24, 48, or 72h after CHG treatment. Previous culture-based studies have found similar results after 24h. Future studies will be needed to determine the mechanisms of bacterial regrowth after CHG treatment. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Annually, over 80,000 central line infections occur in the United States. Understanding the pathogenesis of these infections is crucial. Chlorhexidine is the most commonly used skin preparation before line placement. We hypothesized that the use of chlorhexidine and dressings will alter the normal arm skin microbiome over a period of 72h. We used 16S-rRNA gene next generation sequencing (NGS) to determine the forearm skin microbiome of volunteers. The left arm was swabbed with chlorhexidine and the right arm served as control. The skin microbiome returned to normal after 24h. Our NGS results confirm findings of two previous culture-based studies. Relative abundance of <i>Bacillus</i> spp. in the chlorhexidine-treated samples was increased, consistent with one previous study. Based on the results of this pilot study, we will need to measure viable bacteria during a 24h time course following chlorhexidine treatment to understand the source of skin microbiome replenishment.

We comparatively assessed the microbial community compositions from excision specimens of the main human non-melanoma skin cancers, actinic keratosis (AK), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Keratinocyte skin tumors are characterized by significantly different microbial community compositions, wherein AK and SCC are more similar to each other than to BCC. Notably, in SCC, which represents the advanced tumor entity and frequently develops from AK, overabundance of Staphylococcus aureus, a known skin pathogen, was noted. Moreover, S. aureus overabundance was significantly associated with increased human β-defensin-2 (hBD-2) expression in SCC. By challenging human SCC cell lines with S. aureus, a specific induction of hBD-2 expression and increased tumor cell growth was seen. Increased proliferation was also induced by directly challenging SCC cells with hBD-2. Together, our data indicate that a changed microbial community composition in SCC, specified by S. aureus overabundance, might promote tumor cell growth via modulation of hBD-2 expression.

Social learning has the potential to be an equally potent learning strategy for artificial systems and robots in specific. However, given the complexity and unstructured nature of social learning, implementing social machine learning proves to be a challenging problem. We study one particular aspect of social machine learning: that of offering social cues during the learning interaction. Specifically, we study whether people are sensitive to social cues offered by a learning robot, in a similar way to children's social bids for tutoring. We use a child-like social robot and a task in which the robot has to learn the meaning of words. For this a simple turn-based interaction is used, based on language games. Two conditions are tested: one in which the robot uses social means to invite a human teacher to provide information based on what the robot requires to fill gaps in its knowledge (i.e. expression of a learning preference); the other in which the robot does not provide social cues to communicate a learning preference. We observe that conveying a learning preference through the use of social cues results in better and faster learning by the robot. People also seem to form a ""mental model"" of the robot, tailoring the tutoring to the robot's performance as opposed to using simply random teaching. In addition, the social learning shows a clear gender effect with female participants being responsive to the robot's bids, while male teachers appear to be less receptive. This work shows how additional social cues in social machine learning can result in people offering better quality learning input to artificial systems, resulting in improved learning performance."

Development of the skin microbiome in preterm infants or its determinants in the first 4 weeks of life has not been evaluated.<h4>Methods</h4>We evaluated the skin microbiome from three body sites, antecubital fossa, forehead and gluteal region, in a prospective cohort of 15 preterm (birth weight < 1500 g and < 32 weeks of gestation) and 15 term neonates. The microbiome community membership and relative abundance were evaluated by amplification and sequencing the bacterial V3-V5 region of the16S rRNA gene on the 454 GS FLX platform. We used linear mixed effects models to analyze longitudinal data.<h4>Results</h4>The structure and composition of the skin microbiome did not differ between the three sampling sites for term and preterm infants in the neonatal period. However, skin bacterial richness was positively associated with gestational age in the first four weeks of life. Intravenous antibiotics negatively impacted the bacterial diversity of the skin but we did not see differences with respect to feeding or mode of delivery.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Gestational age, which influences the maturity of skin structure and function, is associated with the development of the preterm cutaneous microbiome. Understanding the maturation of a healthy skin microbiome, prevention of pathogen colonization and its role in the development of immunity will be pivotal in the development of novel interventions to prevent infections in critically ill preterm infants.

Here, we examined the roles of dermal cDC1s and cDC2s during bacterial infection, notably Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes). cDC1s, but not cDC2s, regulated the magnitude of the immune response to P. acnes in the murine dermis by controlling neutrophil recruitment to the inflamed site and survival and function therein. Single-cell mRNA sequencing revealed that this regulation relied on secretion of the cytokine vascular endothelial growth factor α (VEGF-α) by a minor subset of activated EpCAM+CD59+Ly-6D+ cDC1s. Neutrophil recruitment by dermal cDC1s was also observed during S. aureus, bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), or E. coli infection, as well as in a model of bacterial insult in human skin. Thus, skin cDC1s are essential regulators of the innate response in cutaneous immunity and have roles beyond classical antigen presentation.
