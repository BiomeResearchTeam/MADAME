A few closely related species, including Bordetella pertussis, are human pathogens that cause diseases such as whooping cough. Here, we present a large database of Bordetella isolates and genomes and develop genotyping systems for the genus and for the B. pertussis clade. To generate the database, we merge previously existing databases from Oxford University and Institut Pasteur, import genomes from public repositories, and add 83 newly sequenced B. bronchiseptica genomes. The public database currently includes 2582 Bordetella isolates and their provenance data, and 2085 genomes ( https://bigsdb.pasteur.fr/bordetella/ ). We use core-genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) to develop genotyping systems for the whole genus and for B. pertussis, as well as specific schemes to define antigenic, virulence and macrolide resistance profiles. Phylogenetic analyses allow us to redefine evolutionary relationships among known Bordetella species, and to propose potential new species. Our database provides an expandable resource for genotyping of environmental and clinical Bordetella isolates, thus facilitating evolutionary and epidemiological research on whooping cough and other Bordetella infections.

We hypothesized that the nose/throat microbiota modifies the duration of influenza symptoms and viral shedding. Exploring these relationships may help identify additional methods for reducing influenza severity and transmission.<h4>Methods</h4>Using a household transmission study in Nicaragua, we identified secondary cases of influenza virus infection, defined as contacts with detectable virus or a greater than 4-fold change in hemagglutinin inhibition antibody titer. We characterized the nose/throat microbiota of secondary cases before infection and explored whether the duration of symptoms and shedding differed by bacterial community characteristics.<h4>Results</h4>Among 124 secondary cases of influenza, higher bacterial community diversity before infection was associated with longer shedding duration (Shannon acceleration factor [AF]: 1.61, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.24, 2.10) and earlier time to infection (Shannon AF: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.53, 0.97; Chao1 AF: 0.992, 95% CI: 0.986, 0.998). Neisseria and multiple other oligotypes were significantly associated with symptom and shedding durations and time to infection.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The nose/throat microbiota before influenza virus infection was associated with influenza symptoms and shedding durations. Further studies are needed to determine if the nose/throat microbiota is a viable target for reducing influenza symptoms and transmission."

As Public Health curricula attempt to keep pace with the most recent advances in genomics, students should gain experience with analyzing genomic data and applying genomic tools to the study of health-related issues. To advance undergraduate and graduate student education and provide a more comprehensive view of genomics, we developed an educational project including both pedagogic and research components to characterize skin microbial communities (microbiomes) using targeted amplicon sequencing of their genomes (metataxonomy). All students completed the lab procedures, analyzed 16S rRNA genomic data (formative assessments), and wrote a five-page scientific report summarizing and discussing their results (summative assessment). Student grades for the summative assessment ranged from 31.5 to 40 (out of 40) points. They also successfully completed two practicums (problem sets) focused on microbiome sequence data and responded to 12 minute-papers related to genomic topics covered in class. In all these exercises the 2019 students outperformed 2018 students, who did not participate in this educational lab project. By fulfilling all the requirements of this project-based learning experience, students better understood the complexity of genomics and acquired a valuable set of marketable experience and skills in molecular technologies, bioinformatics and statistics (quantitative skills). Additionally, students were able to generate new valuable microbial 16S rRNA genomic data and test hypotheses about the composition and diversity of the microbes living on our skin (microbiota).

Therefore, our study attempted to define the ""ideal skin"" of oriental women and analyze the relationship between different skin physiological parameters and microbiomes.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>Based on our customized grading standard, the VISIA CR photos of 111 young women aged from 18 to 25 in Shanghai were collected and scored by the severity of pores, acne, spots, and wrinkles. The volunteers were then divided into ""ideal skin"" (W1), ""normal skin"" (W2), and ""undesirable skin"" (W3) groups. The physiological parameters of facial skin were measured by non-invasive instrumental methods, and the skin microbiome was analyzed by 16S rRNA and ITS high-throughput sequencing.<h4>Results</h4>From ""ideal skin"" to ""undesirable skin"", the skin physiological parameters, α-diversity, and composition of the facial microbiome showed noticeable regular changes. Compared with the ""normal skin"" (W2) and ""undesirable skin"" (W3), the ""ideal skin"" (W1) group had lower sebum content, TEWL, melanin, hemoglobin, and roughness but higher hydration content and skin pH value. Furthermore, the Shannon index of skin bacteria was significantly increased in W1 (<i>P</i> = 0.004), suggesting that the ideal skin had higher species diversity. From W1 to W3, the species composition was changed significantly. The abundance of <i>Actinobacteria</i> was increased, while <i>Proteobacteria</i> and <i>Bacteroidetes</i> were decreased. Correspondingly, the abundances of lipophilic <i>Propionibacterium</i> and <i>Malassezia</i> were increased, while the abundances of <i>Stenotrophomonas, Pseudomonas, Ralstonia</i>, and <i>Streptococcus</i>, were significantly decreased. Additionally, Spearman correlation analysis revealed strong correlations between the physiological parameters and the microbiota. Notably, the Shannon index of skin bacteria was significantly positively correlated with skin hydration (<i>P</i> = 0.03) but negatively correlated with the abundance of <i>Cutibacterium</i> (<i>P</i> = 0.000), hemoglobin content (<i>P</i> = 0.025), and sebum content (<i>P</i> = 0.5). Therefore, the skin hydration content and the abundance of <i>Cutibacterium</i> played an important role in maintaining the α-diversity and skin homeostasis.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Ideal skin had better water-oil balance and barrier function, higher microbial diversity, and more reasonable species distribution. Therefore, daily skincare needs to control skin oil and maintain skin microecological balance to achieve ideal skin conditions for young women aged 18-25 years old."

To explore the contributions of these factors to skin microbiome variation, we profiled the bacterial microbiomes of 495 North American subjects (ages, 9 to 78 years) at four skin surfaces plus the oral epithelium using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. We collected subject metadata, including host physiological parameters, through standardized questionnaires and noninvasive biophysical methods. Using a combination of statistical modeling tools, we found that demographic, lifestyle, and physiological factors collectively explained 12 to 20% of the variability in microbiome composition. The influence of health factors was strongest on the oral microbiome. Associations between host factors and the skin microbiome were generally dominated by operational taxonomic units (OTUs) affiliated with the Clostridiales and Prevotella A subset of the correlations between microbial features and host attributes were site specific. To further explore the relationship between age and the skin microbiome of the forehead, we trained a Random Forest regression model to predict chronological age from microbial features. Age was associated mostly with two mutually coexcluding Corynebacterium OTUs. Furthermore, skin aging variables (wrinkles and hyperpigmented spots) were independently correlated to these taxa.IMPORTANCE Many studies have highlighted the importance of body site and individuality in shaping the composition of the human skin microbiome, but we still have a poor understanding of how extrinsic (e.g., lifestyle) and intrinsic (e.g., age) factors influence its composition. We characterized the bacterial microbiomes of North American volunteers at four skin sites and the mouth. We also collected extensive subject metadata and measured several host physiological parameters. Integration of host and microbial features showed that the skin microbiome was predominantly associated with demographic, lifestyle, and physiological factors. Furthermore, we uncovered reproducible associations between chronological age, skin aging, and members of the genus Corynebacterium Our work provides new understanding of the role of host selection and lifestyle in shaping skin microbiome composition. It also contributes to a more comprehensive appreciation of the factors that drive interindividual skin microbiome variation.	Microbiome Insights, Inc., Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

Specimens were swabbed from the cheek and forehead of 45 mild acne vulgaris patients, representing mask-covered area (MCA) and mask-uncovered area (MUA), respectively. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing and QIIME2 were used to characterize bacterial communities.<h4>Results</h4>There were 12 (26.7%) and 33 (73.3%) participants in SMWT and LMWT, respectively. There were no significant differences in beta diversity across MCA/MUA or LMWT/SMWT groups. In alpha-diversity, the evenness on MCA was significantly lower in LMWT than in SMWT (<i>p</i> value = 0.049). Among all groups, the relative abundance of bacterial taxa was similar, showing Actinobacteriota and Firmicutes, and <i>Cutibacterium</i> and <i>Staphylococcus</i> as the most predominant phyla and genera, respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our results showed no significant impact of mask-wearing on the skin microbiota in mild acne vulgaris participants."

Bacterial diversity and dynamics during decomposition are influenced by each individual's micro and macroenvironment, ante and postmortem conditions, varying across body sites and time. The skin, the largest organ of the human body, hosts a diverse microbial diversity, representing the first line of defense of a living individual. Targeting the investigation of the postmortem skin microbiome could help understanding the role of microbes during decomposition, and association with the ante and postmortem conditions.<h4>Methods</h4>The current study aimed to identify the postmortem skin microbiome signatures associated with eight human bodies, received at the Institute of Legal Medicine Iasi, Romania, during April and May 2021. A total of 162 samples (including triplicate) representing face and hands skin microbiome were investigated via Illumina MiSeq, upon arrival at the morgue (T0) and after 12 hours (T1).<h4>Results</h4>The taxonomic characteristics of the skin microbiota varied across different body sites. However, there were no significant differences in taxonomic profiles between collection time, T0 and T1, except for some dynamic changes in the abundance of dominant bacteria. Moreover, different microbial signatures have been associated with a specific cause of death, such as cardiovascular disease, while an elevated blood alcohol level could be associated with a decrease in bacterial richness and diversity.<h4>Discussion</h4>The places where the bodies were discovered seemed to play an important role in explaining the bacterial diversity composition. This study shows promising results towards finding common postmortem bacterial signatures associated with human cadavers within the first 12h at the morgue.

We used genomic, phenotypic and virulence studies to identify differences between Acinetobacter species. Fourteen strains representing nine species were examined. Genomic analysis of six strains showed that the A. baumannii core genome contains many genes important for diverse metabolism and survival in the host. Most of the A. baumannii core genes were also present in one or more of the less clinically successful species. In contrast, when the accessory genome of an individual A. baumannii strain was compared to a strain of a less successful species (A. calcoaceticus RUH2202), many operons with putative virulence function were found to be present only in the A. baumannii strain, including the csu operon, the acinetobactin chromosomal cluster, and bacterial defence mechanisms. Phenotype microarray analysis showed that compared to A. calcoaceticus (RUH2202), A. baumannii ATCC 19606(T) was able to utilise nitrogen sources more effectively and was more tolerant to pH, osmotic and antimicrobial stress. Virulence differences were also observed, with A. baumannii ATCC 19606(T), A. pittii SH024, and A. nosocomialis RUH2624 persisting and forming larger biofilms on human skin than A. calcoaceticus. A. baumannii ATCC 19606(T) and A. pittii SH024 were also able to survive in a murine thigh infection model, whereas the other two species were eradicated.

In order to investigate the impact of OFC on oral microbiota, smear samples from 15 neonates with OFC and 17 neonates without OFC were collected from two oral niches (tongue, cheek) at two time points, i.e. after birth (T0: Ø3d OFC group; Ø2d control group) and 4-5 weeks later (T1: Ø32d OFC group; Ø31d control group). Subsequently, the samples were analyzed using next-generation sequencing. We detected a significant increase of alpha diversity and <i>anaerobic</i> and <i>Gram-negative species</i> from T0 to T1 in both groups. Further, we found that at T1 OFC neonates presented a significantly lower alpha diversity (lowest values for high cleft severity) and significantly higher levels of <i>Enterobacteriaceae (Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Escherichia-Shigella, Klebsiella), Enterococcus, Bifidobacterium, Corynebacterium, Lactocaseibacillus, Staphylococcus, Acinetobacter</i> and <i>Lawsonella</i> compared to controls.

However, long-read sequencing now allows for the profiling of near-full-length ribosomal operons (16S-ITS-23S rRNA genes) on platforms such as the Oxford Nanopore MinION. Here, we describe an rRNA operon database with >300 ,000 entries, representing >10 ,000 prokaryotic species and ∼ 150, 000 strains. Additionally, BLAST parameters were identified for strain-level resolution using <i>in silico</i> mutated, mock rRNA operon sequences (70-95% identity) from four bacterial phyla and two members of the Euryarchaeota, mimicking MinION reads. MegaBLAST settings were determined that required <3 s per read on a Mac Mini with strain-level resolution for sequences with >84% identity. These settings were tested on rRNA operon libraries from the human respiratory tract, farm/forest soils and marine sponges ( <i>n</i> = 1, 322, 818 reads for all sample sets). Most rRNA operon reads in this data set yielded best BLAST hits (95 ± 8%). However, only 38-82% of library reads were compatible with strain-level resolution, reflecting the dominance of human/biomedical-associated prokaryotic entries in the database. Since the MinION and the Mac Mini are both portable, this study demonstrates the possibility of rapid strain-level microbiome analysis in the field.

However, a small percentage (<5%) of bacterial species were at higher abundance within the lavage samples. The most abundant lung-enriched bacterial species were Veillonella dispar and Veillonella atypica while the most abundant mouth-associated bacterial species were Streptococcus infantis and Streptococcus mitis.

Notably, facial skin microbiota (SM) samples were collected from a cohort of 15 healthy Caucasian females, firstly divided into three age groups (younger women aged 20-35 years old; middle aged women of 36-52 years old; and older women aged 53-68 years old). Then, the recruited cohort was divided into two groups based on their facial hydration level (dry and normal skin). The facial SM revealed a different composition in the three analyzed aging groups and between normal and dry skins. The middle-aged women also revealed functional variations associated with collagen biosynthesis and oxidative stress damage repair. Otherwise, the association between selected host SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) and the facial SM profile showed significant associations, suggesting a negative correlation with collagen metabolism and ROS damage protection. Finally, the composition and functionality of the facial SM seemed to affect the aging process through the two aging-correlated pathways of host ROS damage repair and collagen metabolism. Our exploratory data could be useful for future studies characterizing the structure, function, and dynamics of the SM in the aging process to design personalized therapeutic agents focusing on potential genomic targets, microbes, and their metabolites."

While it is known that flies have their own unique core microbiome, it is not known if flies associated with human cadavers have a different core microbiome. Differences in the fly microbiome may influence the types of microbes transmitted from the flies to the cadaver, therefore potentially affecting assembly of the human decomposer microbiome. The first purpose of this study was to characterize the microbiome of flies associated with human cadavers by fly organ and season. This is because fly interactions with cadavers vary by season, and because it is likely that external fly organs [i.e., the labellum and tarsi] make more direct contact and are likely involved in increased mechanical transmission with the cadaver than internal organs such as the oocyte. The second purpose of this study was to determine if the fly microbes contribute to the human decomposer microbiome. To accomplish these aims, 10 human cadavers were placed outdoors across three seasons and allowed to decompose. A total of 40 flies that landed on the cadaver were collected and dissected by the labellum, tarsi, and oocyte. In addition to fly collections, samples from the cadavers were collected using a sterile swab at sites including the cheek of the face, inner cheek, bicep, torso, and anus. Overall, it was shown that flies associated with human cadavers have a similar microbiome to flies from previous studies that were not associated with human cadavers. However, there are differences in the microbiome between seasons and fly parts. We also show evidence that flies act as a microbial source to the human decomposer microbiome, which is important for understanding the ecological mechanisms of human cadaver microbial community assembly.

Here, we sought to characterize the oral microbial signatures of HIV+ and HIV- individuals at different levels of PD severity.This cross-sectional study included both HIV+ and HIV- patients with varying degrees of PD. Two tooth, 2 cheek, and 1 saliva samples were obtained for microbiome analysis. Mothur/SILVADB were used to classify sequences. R/Bioconductor (Vegan, PhyloSeq, and DESeq2) was employed to assess overall microbiome structure differences and differential abundance of bacterial genera between groups. Polychromatic flow cytometry was used to assess immune activation in CD4 and CD8 cell populations.Around 250 cheek, tooth, and saliva samples from 50 participants (40 HIV+ and 10 HIV-) were included. Severity of PD was classified clinically as None/Mild (N), Moderate (M), and Severe (S) with 18 (36%), 16 (32%), and 16 (32%) participants in each category, respectively. Globally, ordination analysis demonstrated clustering by anatomic site (R2 = 0.25, P < 0.001). HIV status and PD severity showed a statistically significant impact on microbiome composition but only accounted for a combined 2% of variation. HIV+ samples were enriched in genera Abiotrophia, Neisseria, Kingella, and unclassified Neisseriaceae and depleted in Leptotrichia and Selenomonas. The Neisseria genus was consistently enriched in HIV+ participants regardless of sampling site and PD level. Immune markers were altered in HIV+ participants but did not show association with the oral microbiome.HIV-associated changes in oral microbiome result in subtle microbial signatures along different stages of PD that are common in independent oral anatomic sites.

In mammals, the upper respiratory tract acts as a gateway for pathogen invasion, and the dynamic interaction between microbiota and mucosal immunity on its surface can effectively prevent disease development. However, the relationship between virus-mediated mucosal immune responses and microbes in lower vertebrates remains uncharacterized. In this study, we successfully constructed an infection model by intraperitoneally injecting common carp (<i>Cyprinus carpio</i>) with spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV). In addition to the detection of the SVCV in the nose and pharynx of common carp, we also identified obvious histopathological changes following viral infection. Moreover, numerous immune-related genes were significantly upregulated in the nose and pharynx at the peak of SVCV infection, after which the expression levels decreased to levels similar to those of the control group. Transcriptome sequencing results revealed that pathways associated with bacterial infection in the Toll-like receptor pathway and the Nod-like receptor pathway were activated in addition to the virus-related Rig-I-like receptor pathway after SVCV infection, suggesting that viral infection may be followed by opportunistic bacterial infection in these mucosal tissues. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we further identified an upward trend in pathogenic bacteria on the mucosal surface of the nose and pharynx 4 days after SVCV infection, after which these tissues eventually reached new homeostasis. Taken together, our results suggest that the dynamic interaction between mucosal immunity and microbiota promotes the host to a new ecological state.

Comparing wild animals to those in zoos or aquariums can help disentangle the effects of host versus environmental factors, while also testing whether managed conditions foster a 'natural' host microbiome. Focusing on an endangered elasmobranch species-the whitespotted eagle ray Aetobatus narinari-we compared the skin, gill, and cloaca microbiomes of wild individuals to those at Georgia Aquarium. Whitespotted eagle ray microbiomes from Georgia Aquarium were also compared to those of cownose rays (Rhinoptera bonasus) in the same exhibit, allowing us to explore the effect of host identity on the ray microbiome.<h4>Results</h4>Long-term veterinary monitoring indicated that the rays in managed care did not have a history of disease and maintained health parameters consistent with those of wild individuals, with one exception. Aquarium whitespotted eagle rays were regularly treated to control parasite loads, but the effects on animal health were subclinical. Microbiome α- and β-diversity differed between wild versus aquarium whitespotted eagle rays at all body sites, with α-diversity significantly higher in wild individuals. β-diversity differences in wild versus aquarium whitespotted eagle rays were greater for skin and gill microbiomes compared to those of the cloaca. At each body site, we also detected microbial taxa shared between wild and aquarium eagle rays. Additionally, the cloaca, skin, and gill microbiomes of aquarium eagle rays differed from those of cownose rays in the same exhibit. Potentially pathogenic bacteria were at low abundance in all wild and aquarium rays.<h4>Conclusion</h4>For whitespotted eagle rays, managed care was associated with a microbiome differing significantly from that of wild individuals. These differences were not absolute, as the microbiome of aquarium rays shared members with that of wild counterparts and was distinct from that of a cohabitating ray species. Eagle rays under managed care appear healthy, suggesting that their microbiomes are not associated with compromised host health. However, the ray microbiome is dynamic, differing with both environmental factors and host identity. Monitoring of aquarium ray microbiomes over time may identify taxonomic patterns that co-vary with host health.	School of Biological Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA.

In this study, we explored the properties of this understudied lactic acid bacterium by integrating comparative genomics, habitat mining, cultivation, and functional characterization of interaction capacities. Mining 10.000 samples from the Earth Microbiome Project of 17 habitat types revealed that <i>Dolosigranulum</i> is mainly associated with the human nasal cavity. <i>D. pigrum</i> AMBR11 isolated from the nose of a healthy individual exerted antimicrobial activity against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, decreased proinflammatory cytokine production in airway epithelial cells, and <i>Galleria mellonella</i> larvae mortality induced by this important nasal pathobiont.

While most studies have focused on potential pathogens, this study aimed to find bacteria that could be protective against OME through a case-control microbiome study and characterization of isolates from healthy subjects. The URT and ear microbiome profiles of 70 chronic OME patients and 53 controls were compared by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Haemophilus influenzae was the most frequent classic middle ear pathobiont. However, other taxa, especially Alloiococcus otitis, were also frequently detected in the ear canal of OME patients. Streptococci of the salivarius group and Acinetobacter lwoffii were more abundant in the nasopharynx of healthy controls than in OME patients. In addition to the microbiome analysis, 142 taxa were isolated from healthy individuals, and 79 isolates of 13 different Streptococcus species were tested for their pathobiont-inhibiting potential. Of these, Streptococcus salivarius isolates showed a superior capacity to inhibit the growth of H. influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, A. otitis, and Corynebacterium otitidisS. salivarius strains thus show potential as a probiotic for prevention or treatment of OME based on their overrepresentation in the healthy nasopharynx and their ability to inhibit the growth of respiratory pathobionts. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration no. NCT03109496.)IMPORTANCE The majority of probiotics marketed today target gastrointestinal health. This study searched for bacteria native to the human upper respiratory tract, with a beneficial potential for respiratory and middle ear health. Comparison of the microbiomes of children with chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) and of healthy controls identified Streptococcus salivarius as a health-associated and prevalent inhabitant of the human nasopharynx. However, beneficial potential should be assessed at strain level. Here, we also isolated specific S. salivarius strains from the healthy individuals in our study. These isolates showed a beneficial safety profile and efficacy potential to inhibit OME pathogens in vitro These properties will now have to be evaluated and confirmed in human clinical studies.

Here, we performed a large-scale comparative analysis by using 183 publicly available genomes supplemented with a Lactobacillus strain isolated from the human upper respiratory tract. On the basis of this analysis, we identified inconsistencies in the taxonomy and reclassified all of the genomes according to their most closely related type strains. This led to the identification of a catalase-encoding gene in all 10 L. casei sensu stricto strains, making it the first described catalase-positive species in the Lactobacillus genus. Moreover, we found that 6 of 10 L. casei genomes contained a SecA2/SecY2 gene cluster with two putative glycosylated surface adhesin proteins. Altogether, our results highlight current inconsistencies in the taxonomy of the L. casei group and reveal new clade-associated functional features. IMPORTANCE The closely related species of the Lactobacillus casei group are extensively studied because of their applications in food fermentations and as probiotics. Our results show that many strains in this group are incorrectly classified and that reclassifying them to their most closely related species type strain improves the functional predictive power of their taxonomy. In addition, our findings may spark increased interest in the L. casei species. We find that after reclassification, only 10 genomes remain classified as L. casei. These strains show some interesting properties. First, they all appear to be catalase positive. This suggests that they have increased oxidative stress resistance. Second, we isolated an L. casei strain from the human upper respiratory tract and discovered that it and multiple other L. casei strains harbor one or even two large, glycosylated putative surface adhesins. This might inspire further exploration of this species as a potential probiotic organism.

In this study, we demonstrate that taxa from the beneficial Lactobacillus genus complex are more prevalent in the healthy URT than in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Several URT-specific isolates are cultured, characterized, and further explored for their genetic and functional properties related to adaptation to the URT. Catalase genes are found in the identified lactobacilli, which is a unique feature within this mostly facultative anaerobic genus. Moreover, one of our isolated strains, Lactobacillus casei AMBR2, contains fimbriae that enable strong adherence to URT epithelium, inhibit the growth and virulence of several URT pathogens, and successfully colonize nasal epithelium of healthy volunteers. This study thus demonstrates that specific lactobacilli are adapted to the URT and could have a beneficial keystone function in this habitat.

Here, we report for the first time the effect of isotretinoin and lymecycline therapy on the skin microbiota in cheek, back and armpit swab samples of acne vulgaris patients using 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene amplicon sequencing. Propionibacterium acnes was the most common in sebaceous areas of healthy and untreated acne skin and more abundant in back than cheek samples. Five taxa, including a Streptococcus taxon, differed significantly between the cheek samples of healthy controls and acne patients, and acne severity was positively correlated with the abundance of Propionibacterium. Both treatments reduced clinical acne grades and the abundance of Propionibacterium, while the abundance of several other taxa was significantly higher in treated cheek samples compared with untreated ones. Less variation was observed in back samples and none in armpit samples. There were no differences in alpha diversity between control and acne patients in any of the sampled skin areas, but the diversity of the microbiota on the cheek and the back was significantly increased after acne treatments. This study provides insight into the skin microbiota in acne and how it is modulated by systemic acne treatment.	Department of Dermatology, PEDEGO Research Center, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland.

Despite strong evidence of association between bacterial skin colonisation and AD, very limited knowledge regarding the eukaryotic microbial community, including fungi and ectoparasites, in AD exists. In this study, we compared the skin and nasal eukaryotic microbial community between adult AD patients (n = 55) and non-AD healthy controls (n = 45) using targeted 18S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Analysis was based on the presence or absence of eukaryotic microorganisms.<h4>Results</h4>The cutaneous composition of the eukaryotic microbial community and the alpha-diversity differed significantly between AD patients and non-AD individuals, with increased species richness on AD skin. Alpha-diversity and beta-diversity were similar on lesional and non-lesional skin of patients. The ectoparasite Demodex folliculorum and the yeast Geotrichum candidum were significantly more prevalent on the skin of AD patients. The prevalence of D. folliculorum on lesional skin was greater among patients recently treated with topical corticosteroid. Malassezia was one of the most frequently detected genera at all sites, with M. globosa and M. restricta being the most prevalent. M. restricta was under represented in the anterior nares of AD patients as compared to the non-AD control population.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Significant differences in the eukaryotic microbial communities were found between AD patients and non-AD individuals, with the most striking finding being the significantly overrepresentation of D. folliculorum on AD skin.

Little is known about the urogenital archaeome although several reports have indicated that the archaeomes of various regions of the human body are associated with health. Accordingly, we aimed to determine the presence and diversity of archaeomes in the human urogenital tract. To explore the urogenital archaeome, voided urine specimens from 373 asymptomatic Korean individuals were used. No difference was observed in body mass index, age, or gender, according to presence of archaea. Analysis of archaeal 16S rRNA gene amplicons of archaea positive samples consisted of simple community structures, including diverse archaea, such as the phyla Methanobacteriota, Thermoproteota, and Halobacteriota. Asymptomatic individuals showed high participant-dependent intervariability in their urogenital archaeomes. The mean relative archaeal abundance was estimated to be 0.89%, and fluorescence in situ hybridisation micrographs provided evidence of archaeal cells in the human urogenital tract. In addition, the urogenital archaeome shared partial taxonomic compositional characteristics with those of the other body sites. In this study, Methanobacteriota, Thermoproteota, and Halobacteriota were suggested as inhabitants of the human urogenital tract, and a distinct human urogenital archaeome was characterised. These findings expand our knowledge of archaea-host associations in the human urogenital tract and may lead to novel insights into the role of archaea in urinary tract health.

Knowledge on the abundance and diversity of human-associated archaea is extremely limited, and little is known about their function(s), their overall role in human health, or their association with parts of the human body other than the gastrointestinal tract and oral cavity. Currently, methodological issues impede the full assessment of the human archaeome, as bacteria-targeting protocols are unsuitable for characterization of the full spectrum of Archaea The goal of this study was to establish conservative protocols based on specifically archaea-targeting, PCR-based methods to retrieve first insights into the archaeomes of the human gastrointestinal tract, lung, nose, and skin. Detection of Archaea was highly dependent on primer selection and the sequence processing pipeline used. Our results enabled us to retrieve a novel picture of the human archaeome, as we found for the first time Methanobacterium and Woesearchaeota (DPANN superphylum) to be associated with the human gastrointestinal tract and the human lung, respectively. Similar to bacteria, human-associated archaeal communities were found to group biogeographically, forming (i) the thaumarchaeal skin landscape, (ii) the (methano)euryarchaeal gastrointestinal tract, (iii) a mixed skin-gastrointestinal tract landscape for the nose, and (iv) a woesearchaeal lung landscape. On the basis of the protocols we used, we were able to detect unexpectedly high diversity of archaea associated with different body parts.IMPORTANCE In summary, our study highlights the importance of the primers and data processing pipeline used to study the human archaeome. We were able to establish protocols that revealed the presence of previously undetected Archaea in all of the tissue samples investigated and to detect biogeographic patterns of the human archaeome in the gastrointestinal tract and on the skin and for the first time in the respiratory tract, i.e., the nose and lungs. Our results are a solid basis for further investigation of the human archaeome and, in the long term, discovery of the potential role of archaea in human health and disease.

Here, we show that lactobacilli are underestimated members of the skin microbiota. We select specific strains of nomadic lactobacilli for their functional applicability on the skin and capacity to inhibit growth and inflammation by skin pathobionts. The strains are formulated as microcapsules for topical formulations and tested in patients with mild-to-moderate acne. The selected lactobacilli are able to reduce inflammatory lesions in a pilot and placebo-controlled study. Daily application for 8 weeks is associated with an <i>in vivo</i> temporary modulation of the microbiome, including a reduction in relative abundance of staphylococci and <i>Cutibacterium acnes</i>, and an increase in lactobacilli. The reduction in inflammatory lesions is still apparent 4 weeks after the topical application of the lactobacilli ended, indicating a possible additional immunomodulatory effect. This study shows that carefully selected and formulated lactobacilli are a viable therapeutic option for common acne lesions.

Here, samples were collected from the anterior nares, nasopharynx, and maxillary and ethmoid sinuses of 190 CRS patients and from the anterior nares and nasopharynx of 100 controls. Microbial communities were analyzed by Illumina sequencing of the V4 region of 16S rRNA. The phenotype and patient characteristics were documented, and several serum inflammatory markers were measured. Our data indicate a rather strong continuity for the microbiome in the different upper respiratory tract (URT) niches in CRS patients, with the microbiome in the anterior nares being most similar to the sinus microbiome. Bacterial diversity was reduced in CRS patients without nasal polyps compared to that in the controls but not in CRS patients with nasal polyps. Statistically significant differences in the presence/absence or relative abundance of several taxa were found between the CRS patients and the healthy controls. Of these, Dolosigranulum pigrum was clearly more associated with URT samples from healthy subjects, while the Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum, Haemophilus influenzae/H. aegyptius, and Staphylococcus taxa were found to be potential pathobionts in CRS patients. However, CRS versus health as a predictor explained only 1 to 2% of the variance in the microbiome profiles in an adonis model. A history of functional endoscopic sinus surgery, age, and sex also showed a minor association. This study thus indicates that functional studies on the potential beneficial versus pathogenic activity of the different indicator taxa found here are needed to further understand the pathology of CRS and its different phenotypes. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under identifier NCT02933983.)IMPORTANCE There is a clear need to better understand the pathology and specific microbiome features in chronic rhinosinusitis patients, but little is known about the bacterial topography and continuity between the different niches of the upper respiratory tract. Our work showed that the anterior nares could be an important reservoir for potential sinus pathobionts. This has implications for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of CRS. In addition, we found a potential pathogenic role for the Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum, Haemophilus influenzae/H. aegyptius, and Staphylococcus taxa and a potential beneficial role for Dolosigranulum Finally, a decreased microbiome diversity was observed in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps compared to that in healthy controls but not in chronic rhinosinusitis patients with nasal polyps. This suggests a potential role for the microbiome in disease development or progression of mainly this phenotype.	University of Antwerp, Department of Bioscience Engineering, Antwerp, Belgium.

Lactobacilli are shown to restore epithelial barrier defects in gastrointestinal disorders, but their effect on the airway epithelial barrier is unknown. In this study, hence, we evaluated whether the nasopharyngeal isolates <i>Lacticaseibacillus casei</i> AMBR2 and <i>Latilactobacillus sakei</i> AMBR8 could restore nasal epithelial barrier integrity in CRSwNP.<h4>Methods</h4><i>Ex vivo</i> trans-epithelial tissue resistance and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran 4 kDa (FD4) permeability of nasal mucosal explants were measured. The relative abundance of lactobacilli in the maxillary sinus of CRSwNP patients was analyzed by amplicon sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The effect of spray-dried <i>L. casei</i> AMBR2 and <i>L. sakei</i> AMBR8 on epithelial integrity was investigated <i>in vitro</i> in primary nasal epithelial cells (pNECs) from healthy controls and patients with CRSwNP as well as <i>in vivo</i> in a murine model of interleukin (IL)-4 induced barrier dysfunction. The activation of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) was explored <i>in vitro</i> by using polyclonal antibodies.<h4>Results</h4>Patients with CRSwNP had a defective epithelial barrier which positively correlated with the relative abundance of lactobacilli-specific amplicons in the maxillary sinus. <i>L. casei</i> AMBR2, but not <i>L. sakei</i> AMBR8, increased the trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of pNECs from CRSwNP patients in a time-dependent manner. Treatment of epithelial cells with <i>L. casei</i> AMBR2 promoted the tight junction proteins occludin and zonula occludens-1 reorganization. Furthermore, <i>L. casei</i> AMBR2 prevented IL-4-induced nasal permeability <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. Finally, the beneficial effect of <i>L. casei</i> AMBR2 on nasal epithelial cells <i>in vitro</i> was TLR2-dependent as blocking TLR2 receptors prevented the increase in TEER.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A defective epithelial barrier in CRSwNP may be associated with a decrease in relative abundance of lactobacilli-specific amplicons. <i>L. casei</i> AMBR2 would restore nasal epithelial integrity and can be a novel therapeutic strategy for CRSwNP.

In this study, we explored the properties of this understudied lactic acid bacterium by integrating comparative genomics, habitat mining, cultivation, and functional characterization of interaction capacities. Mining 10.000 samples from the Earth Microbiome Project of 17 habitat types revealed that <i>Dolosigranulum</i> is mainly associated with the human nasal cavity. <i>D. pigrum</i> AMBR11 isolated from the nose of a healthy individual exerted antimicrobial activity against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, decreased proinflammatory cytokine production in airway epithelial cells, and <i>Galleria mellonella</i> larvae mortality induced by this important nasal pathobiont.

However, little is known about the role of the skin microbiome on skin aging. Here, we report that the Streptococcus species improved the skin structure and barrier function, thereby contributing to anti-aging. Metagenomic analyses showed the abundance of Streptococcus in younger individuals or those having more elastic skin. Particularly, we isolated Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus infantis, and Streptococcus thermophilus from face of young individuals. Treatment with secretions of S. pneumoniae and S. infantis induced the expression of genes associated with the formation of skin structure and the skin barrier function in human skin cells. The application of culture supernatant including Streptococcal secretions on human skin showed marked improvements on skin phenotypes such as elasticity, hydration, and desquamation. Gene Ontology analysis revealed overlaps in spermidine biosynthetic and glycogen biosynthetic processes. Streptococcus-secreted spermidine contributed to the recovery of skin structure and barrier function through the upregulation of collagen and lipid synthesis in aged cells. Overall, our data suggest the role of skin microbiome into anti-aging and clinical applications.

Although several studies have revealed distinct microbiota in asthmatic airways at baseline compared to healthy controls, limited studies compared microbiota during acute exacerbation (AE) and in the recovery phase (RP) in the same asthmatic children. We aim to investigate association between microbiota and asthma status in children and explore their relationship with clinical features of asthma. We recruited 56 asthmatic children and investigated their nasal, throat, and stool microbiota during AE and in the RP. Totally, 320 samples were subjected to 16S rRNA sequencing. Although the microbial communities were clearly separated by body site, within each site the overall communities during AE and in the RP could not be distinguished. Most nasal microbiota were dominated by only one or two of six bacterial genera. The domination was associated with mite allergy and patient age only during AE but not in the RP. When moving into RP, the relative abundance of <i>Staphylococcus</i> increased while that of <i>Moraxella</i> decreased. Throat and stool microbiota were not associated with most of the clinical features. Interestingly, stool microbiota during AE was associated with ABO blood type and stool microbiota in the RP was associated with frequency of the subsequent exacerbations. In summary, the association between nasal microbiota and mite allergy only during AE suggests an altered local immunity and its interplay with nasal microbes. Our work provides a basis for studying microbes, and prevention or therapeutic strategy in childhood asthma, especially during AE.

However, the impact of the host microbiome on infection outcomes has not been explored in this model, partly due to the lack of a comprehensive characterization of microbial communities across different cotton rat species. Understanding the dynamics of their microbiome could significantly help to better understand its role when modeling viral infections in this animal model.<h4>Results</h4>We examined the bacterial communities of the gut and three external sites (skin, ear, and nose) of two inbred species of cotton rats commonly used in research (S. hispidus and S. fulviventer) by using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, constituting the first comprehensive characterization of the cotton rat microbiome. We showed that S. fulviventer maintained higher alpha diversity and richness than S. hispidus at external sites (skin, ear, nose), but there were no differentially abundant genera. However, S. fulviventer and S. hispidus had distinct fecal microbiomes composed of several significantly differentially abundant genera. Whole metagenomic shotgun sequencing of fecal samples identified species-level differences between S. hispidus and S. fulviventer, as well as different metabolic pathway functions as a result of differential host microbiome contributions. Furthermore, the microbiome composition of the external sites showed significant sex-based differences while fecal communities were not largely different.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study shows that host genetic background potentially exerts homeostatic pressures, resulting in distinct microbiomes for two different inbred cotton rat species. Because of the numerous studies that have uncovered strong relationships between host microbiome, viral infection outcomes, and immune responses, our findings represent a strong contribution for understanding the impact of different microbial communities on viral pathogenesis.

Whether mutation and selection among commensal bacteria are associated with infection is unknown. We investigated de novo mutation in 1163 Staphylococcus aureus genomes from 105 infected patients with nose colonization. We report that 72% of infections emerged from the nose, with infecting and nose-colonizing bacteria showing parallel adaptive differences. We found 2.8-to-3.6-fold adaptive enrichments of protein-altering variants in genes responding to rsp, which regulates surface antigens and toxin production; agr, which regulates quorum-sensing, toxin production and abscess formation; and host-derived antimicrobial peptides. Adaptive mutations in pathogenesis-associated genes were 3.1-fold enriched in infecting but not nose-colonizing bacteria. None of these signatures were observed in healthy carriers nor at the species-level, suggesting infection-associated, short-term, within-host selection pressures.

Globally, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in S. aureus remains challenging. While human risk factors for infection have been defined, contradictory evidence exists for the role of bacterial genomic variation in S. aureus disease. To investigate the contribution of bacterial lineage and genomic variation to the development of bloodstream infection, we undertook a genome-wide association study comparing bacteria from 1017 individuals with bacteraemia to 984 adults with asymptomatic S. aureus nasal carriage. Within 984 carriage isolates, we also compared healthcare-associated (HA) carriage with community-associated (CA) carriage. All major global lineages were represented in both bacteraemia and carriage, with no evidence for different infection rates. However, kmers tagging trimethoprim resistance-conferring mutation F99Y in dfrB were significantly associated with bacteraemia-vs-carriage (P=10-8.9-10-9.3). Pooling variation within genes, bacteraemia-vs-carriage was associated with the presence of mecA (HMP=10-5.3) as well as the presence of SCCmec (HMP=10-4.4). Among S. aureus carriers, no lineages were associated with HA-vs-CA carriage. However, we found a novel signal of HA-vs-CA carriage in the foldase protein prsA, where kmers representing conserved sequence allele were associated with CA carriage (P=10-7.1-10-19.4), while in gyrA, a ciprofloxacin resistance-conferring mutation, L84S, was associated with HA carriage (P=10-7.2). In an extensive study of S. aureus bacteraemia and nasal carriage in the UK, we found strong evidence that all S. aureus lineages are equally capable of causing bloodstream infection, and of being carried in the healthcare environment. Genomic variation in the foldase protein prsA is a novel genomic marker of healthcare origin in S. aureus but was not associated with bacteraemia. AMR determinants were associated with both bacteraemia and healthcare-associated carriage, suggesting that AMR increases the propensity not only to survive in healthcare environments, but also to cause invasive disease.

Our objective was to perform an intrasubject and intersite analysis to determine the contributions of two upper mucosal sites (mouth and nose) as source communities for the bacterial microbiome of lower sites (lungs and stomach). Oral wash, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, nasal swab, and gastric aspirate samples were collected from 28 healthy subjects. Extensive analysis of controls and serial intrasubject BAL fluid samples demonstrated that sampling of the lungs by bronchoscopy was not confounded by oral microbiome contamination. By quantitative PCR, the oral cavity and stomach contained the highest bacterial signal levels and the nasal cavity and lungs contained much lower levels. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicon libraries generated from these samples showed that the oral and gastric compartments had the greatest species richness, which was significantly greater in both than the richness measured in the lungs and nasal cavity. The bacterial communities of the lungs were significantly different from those of the mouth, nose, and stomach, while the greatest similarity was between the oral and gastric communities. However, the bacterial communities of healthy lungs shared significant membership with the mouth, but not the nose, and marked subject-subject variation was noted. In summary, microbial immigration from the oral cavity appears to be the significant source of the lung microbiome during health, but unlike the stomach, the lungs exhibit evidence of selective elimination of Prevotella bacteria derived from the upper airways.<h4>Importance</h4>We have demonstrated that the bacterial communities of the healthy lung overlapped those found in the mouth but were found at lower concentrations, with lower membership and a different community composition. The nasal microbiome, which was distinct from the oral microbiome, appeared to contribute little to the composition of the lung microbiome in healthy subjects. Our studies of the nasal, oral, lung, and stomach microbiomes within an individual illustrate the microbiological continuity of the aerodigestive tract in healthy adults and provide culture-independent microbiological support for the concept that microaspiration is common in healthy individuals.

Unraveling the mechanisms employed by invasive plant species is crucial to controlling invasions. One important approach that invasive plants use to outcompete native plants is to disrupt mutualistic interactions between native roots and mycorrhizal fungi. However, it remains unclear how differences in the competitive ability of invasive plants affect native plant associations with mycorrhizae. Here, we examined how a native plant, <i>Xanthium strumarium</i>, responds to invasive plants that differed in competitive abilities (i.e., as represented by aboveground plant biomass) by measuring changes in root nitrogen concentration (root nutrient acquisition) and mycorrhizal colonization rate. We found that both root nitrogen concentration and mycorrhizal colonization rate in the native plant were reduced by invasive plants. The change in mycorrhizal colonization rate of the native plant was negatively correlated with both aboveground plant biomass of the invasive plants and the change in aboveground plant biomass of the native plant in monocultures relative to mixed plantings. In contrast, the change in root nitrogen concentration of the native plant was positively correlated with aboveground plant biomass of the invasive plants and the change in aboveground plant biomass of the native plant. When we compared the changes in mycorrhizal colonization rate and root nitrogen concentration in the native plant grown in monocultures with those of native plants grown with invasive plants, we observed a significant tradeoff. Our study shows that invasive plants can suppress native plants by reducing root nutrient acquisition rather than by disrupting symbiotic mycorrhizal associations, a novel finding likely attributable to a low dependence of the native plant on mycorrhizal fungi.

Here, we report our meta-analysis results on CF airway microbiomes based on metabolic networks reconstructed from genome information at species level. The microbiomes of CF patients appear to engage much more redox-related activities than those of controls, and by constructing a large dataset of anti-oxidative stress (anti-OS) genes, our quantitative evaluation of the anti-OS capacity of each bacterial species in the CF microbiomes confirms strong conservation of the anti-OS responses within genera and also shows that the CF pathogens have significantly higher anti-OS capacity than commensals and other typical respiratory pathogens. In addition, the anti-OS capacity of a relevant species correlates with its relative fitness for the airways of CF patients over that for the airways of controls. Moreover, the total anti-OS capacity of the respiratory microbiome of CF patients is collectively higher than that of controls, which increases with disease progression, especially after episodes of acute exacerbation and antibiotic treatment. According to these results, we propose that the increased OS in the airways of CF patients may play an important role in reshaping airway microbiomes to a more resistant status that favors the pre-infection colonization of the CF pathogens for a higher anti-OS capacity.

Recently, alterations of the nasal resident microbiota have been found in CRS. However, nasal microbial features in NKTCL have never been reported. This case-control study collected 46 NKTCL patients, 25 CRS patients and 24 matched healthy controls (HCs) to analyze nasal microbial profiles <i>via</i> 16S rRNA sequencing technology to improve our understanding of changes in the nasal microbiota in NKTCL. We found that alpha diversity was significantly decreased, while beta diversity was significantly increased in NKTCL compared with those in CRS and HCs. The genus <i>Corynebacterium</i> was significantly depleted in CRS and NKTCL <i>versus</i> that in HCs, while genus <i>Staphylococcus</i> was the most abundant in the NKTCL compared to that in the other two groups. The nasal microbial community was significantly different between UAT-NKTCL and non-UAT NKTCL patients. Importantly, based on a panel of taxa, excellent classification power with an AUC of 0.875 between UAT-NKTCL and CRS was achieved. Furthermore, the alpha diversity of the nasal microbiota was associated with several clinical covariates of NKTCL. Finally, PICRUSt analysis implicated an array of distinct functions in NKTCL that might be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. In conclusion, the nasal microbial profile was unique in NKTCL. The nose-microbiota-UAT NKTCL axis represents a panel of promising biomarkers for clinical practice and contributes to revealing the potential pathogenesis of this malignancy.

Efficient strategies are needed to decontaminate Pd from the bat hibernacula to interrupt the disease transmission cycle without affecting the native microbes. Previously, we discovered a novel Trichoderma polysporum (Tp) strain (WPM 39143), which inhibited the growth of Pd in autoclaved soil samples. In the present investigation, we used culture-based approaches to determine Tp-induced killing of native and enriched Pd in the natural soil of two bat hibernacula. We also assessed the impact of Tp treatment on native microbial communities by metagenomics.<h4>Results</h4>Our results demonstrated that Tp at the concentration of 10<sup>5</sup> conidia/g soil caused 100% killing of native Pd in culture within 5 weeks of incubation. A 10-fold higher concentration of Tp (10<sup>6</sup> conidia/g soil) killed an enriched Pd population (10<sup>5</sup> conidia/g soil). The 12,507 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs, dominated by Ascomycota and Basidiomycota) and 27,427 bacterial OTUs (dominated by Acidobacteria and Proteobacteria) comprised the native soil microbes of the two bat hibernacula. No significant differences in fungal and bacterial relative abundances were observed between untreated and Tp-treated soil (10<sup>5</sup> Tp conidia/g soil, p ≤ 0.05).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results suggest that Tp-induced killing of Pd is highly specific, with minimal to no impact on the indigenous microbes present in the soil samples. These findings provide the scientific rationale for the field trials of Tp in the WNS-affected hibernacula for the effective decontamination of Pd and the control of WNS.

Delanghe L, Cauwenberghs E, Spacova I, De Boeck I, Van Beeck W, Pepermans K, Claes I, Vandenheuvel D, Verhoeven V, Lebeer S.		8	3109505	2021	0	2021	01/01/2021	Frontiers in medicine	Front Med (Lausanne)	Front Med (Lausanne)	101648047	2296-858X	2296-858X	2021	732047	During the current COVID-19 pandemic, the use of face masks has become increasingly recommended and even mandatory in community settings. To evaluate the risk of bacterial cross-contamination, this study analyzed the bacterial bioburden of disposable surgical masks and homemade cotton masks, and surveyed the habits and face mask preferences of the Flemish population. Using culture approaches and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we analyzed the microbial community on surgical and/or cotton face masks of 13 healthy volunteers after 4 h of wearing. Cotton and surgical masks contained on average 1.46 × 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/mask and 1.32 × 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/mask, respectively. <i>Bacillus, Staphylococcus</i>, and <i>Acinetobacter</i> spp. were mostly cultured from the masks and 43% of these isolates were resistant to ampicillin or erythromycin. Microbial profiling demonstrated a consistent difference between mask types. Cotton masks mainly contained <i>Roseomonas, Paracoccus</i>, and <i>Enhydrobacter</i> taxa and surgical masks <i>Streptococcus</i> and <i>Staphylococcus</i>. After 4 h of mask wearing, the microbiome of the anterior nares and the cheek showed a trend toward an altered beta-diversity. According to dedicated questions in the large-scale Corona survey of the University of Antwerp with almost 25,000 participants, only 21% of responders reported to clean their cotton face mask daily. Laboratory results indicated that the best mask cleaning methods were boiling at 100°C, washing at 60°C with detergent or ironing with a steam iron. Taken together, this study suggests that a considerable number of bacteria, including pathobionts and antibiotic resistant bacteria, accumulate on surgical and even more on cotton face masks after use. Based on our results, face masks should be properly disposed of or sterilized after intensive use. Clear guidelines for the general population are crucial to reduce the bacteria-related biosafety risk of face masks, and measures such as physical distancing and increased ventilation should not be neglected when promoting face mask use.

Sølberg J, Jacobsen SB, Andersen JD, Litman T, Ulrich NH, Ahlström MG, Kampmann ML, Morling N, Thyssen JP, Johansen JD.	1.0	101	3102634	2021 Jan	1	2021	01/01/2021	Journal of dermatological science	J Dermatol Sci	J Dermatol Sci	9011485	0923-1811	1873-569X	2021	14-21	<h4>Background</h4>Skin biopsies represent a gold standard in skin immunology and pathology but can cause pain and induce scarring. Non-invasive techniques will facilitate study recruitment of e.g. patients with paediatric atopic dermatitis (AD), hand eczema or facial dermatitis.<h4>Objective</h4>By RNA sequencing, we examined whether the stratum corneum transcriptome in AD skin can be assessed by tape stripping, as compared to the epidermal transcriptome of AD in skin biopsies. To make the procedure clinically relevant tape strips were stored and shipped at room temperature for up to 3 days.<h4>Methods</h4>Nine adult Caucasian AD patients and three healthy volunteers were included. Tape samples were collected from non-lesional and lesional skin. Biopsies were collected from lesional skin and were split into epidermis and dermis. Total RNA was extracted, and shotgun sequencing was performed.<h4>Results</h4>Shotgun sequencing could be performed on skin cells obtained from two consecutive tape strips which had been stored and shipped at room temperature for up to three days. The most prominent differences between the tape strip and biopsy derived transcriptome were due to structural genes, while established molecular markers of AD, including CCL17, CCL22, IL17A and S100A7-S100A9, were also identified in tape strip samples. Furthermore, the tape strip derived transcriptome showed promise in also analysing the skin microbiome.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our study shows that the stratum corneum (SC) transcriptome of AD can be assessed by tape stripping the skin, supporting that this method may be central in future skin biomarker research.
